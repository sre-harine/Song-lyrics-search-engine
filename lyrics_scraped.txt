*"Country Boy"*Well I grew up down an old dirt road in a town you wouldn't know My pops picked the place up for 1500 bucks back in 1964  My grandfather was a drinker back in the day he put 'em down But a war is known to change a man and the whiskey is known to change a man  But, that's not me I rarely drink from the bottle but I smoke a little weed I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go In a town of 1200 off an old dirt road And a country boy is all I'll ever be  Now it's been 12 years since I sold my soul to the devil in L.A. He said "sign your name here on the dotted line and your songs they all will play"  He set up shop on sunset, he put me up at the marquee He said "you wanna sell a million records boy you better listen to me"  He said "change your style, whiten your smile, you could lose a couple of pounds And if you want to live this life, you better lose that wife, do you need your friends around?"  I said, no that's not me Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family And I like my jeans and my old t-shirts And a couple extra pounds never really hurt Cause a country boy is all I'll ever be  Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive You'll never catch me out the house without my 9 or 45  I got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck And my idea of heaven is chasing whitetail bucks And as a country boy you know I can survive  Now two flags fly above my land that really sum up how I feel One is the colors that fly high and proud The red, the white, the blue The other ones got a rattlesnake with a simple statement made "Don't tread on me" is what it says and I'll take that to my grave Because, this is me I'm proud to be American and strong in my beliefs  And I've said it before but I'll say it again Cause I've never needed government to hold my hand And I've said it before but I'll say it again Cause my family has always fought and died to save this land And a country boy is all I'll ever be  I love my country, I love my guns, I love my family I love the way it is now, and anybody that tries to change it Has to come through me, that should be all our attitudes 'cause this is America and a country boy is good enough for me son

*"Massachusetts"*Sing here on the stairs and listen to The nighttime as the daylight fades away It's such a haunting and familiar tune When I hear it in the distance I can say That I'm home...  In Massachusetts Where my daughters and my wife they wait for me... All alone, but the truth is It's where I always am, it's where I long to be Because I'm home  The north shore is where my father lives I wear my Red Sox hat around the world with pride But the Berkshires are where my heart is And when I see them in the distance I could cry Because I'm home...  In Massachusetts Where my daughters and my wife they wait for me... All alone, but the truth is It's where I always am, it's where I long to be  Nyla started pre-school and Indy just turned two And Zoe's just the perfect mix of me and you They keep getting older, time keeps going by To think about it makes your daddy wanna cry  So I just pass the sign that welcomes me to Worthington Established long before this country came to be A place that hasn't really changed with time The way this country that I love, it used to be Because I'm home...  In Massachusetts Where my daughters and my wife they wait for me All alone, but the truth is It's where I always am, it's where I long to be Because I'm home...  In Massachusetts Where my hero teaches classes everyday When my friends, they don't treat me different It's where my family is, it's where I'll always stay Because I'm home

*"Red, White & Blue"*My grandmama worked on a factory floor, Sewing leather for minimum wage, While my granddaddy worked all the beer joints in town, Tryin' to forget the memories he made. Because when daddy was born in 1945, We'd been fighting for what we believed. Along with five other brothers, who stood by his side They were ready they were willing to bleed.  [Chorus:] Red, white and blue Those colors mean something Those colors stay true. Like my family before me, I'll feel it too. The blood that's in my veins, Runs red, white and blue.  My daddy grew up, on the wrong side of poor Rubbin' nickels together for heat. Well, he and his sister had barely got by With the clothes and the shoes on their feet. So he joined the service when he was 18 Like his daddy and his uncles before. He was ready to die for what he believed To fight for what's worth fightin' for  [Chorus:] Red, white and blue Those colors mean something Those colors stay true. Like my family before me, I'll feel it too. The blood that's in my veins, Runs red, white and blue.  Well me and my sisters got kids of our own And my brothers comin up on sixteen And my daddy taught us all how to live off the land And how to stand up for what we believe  [Chorus:] Red, white and blue Those colors mean something Those colors stay true. Like my family before me, I'll feel it too. The blood that's in my veins, Runs red, white and blue. Like my family before me I feel it too The blood that's in my veins, Runs red, white and blue. The blood that's in my veins Runs red white and blue
*"Lessons Learned"*I've walked a mile in the shoes of a broken man I've fallen down a thousand times and got up again there's times I've talked to god like he's my only friend There's time it seems the devil's trying to take me by the hand  In life, sometimes you gotta slow it down a little bit take time, rewind, appreciate the little things that life provides to you  I'll borrow pages from the life of johnny cash I've tried to find the answer in the whiskey glass I've done a lot of things back in my shady past I've sat on that metal bed living way too fast  Cause in life sometimes you gotta slow it down a little bit take time, rewind, appreciate the little things that life provides to you  And these pictures running through my head as I sat there on that cold metal bed and wonder how I wound up here again  Cause in life you'll find you gotta slow it down a little bit take time, rewind, appreciate the little things that life provides to you
*"Forever"*Another cheap high rise hotel room Another place another show Another meaningless...

*"Burnt The Sawmill Down"*Dirt road, Georgia, childhood days A sawmill way of life Where I grew up to love a rich girl Who could never be my wife  And the roses near their mansion On a cool, Southern ground She cut a memory into mine But I had to leave that town  Dirt poor, backwoods, I was was raised Now the lawman's comin' round Mama said I raised a good boy But he burnt the sawmill down  It's been years since I left Georgia And I left there on the run They say her daddy's still in a rage Over what I done  But he shot at me for lovin' her Thought he run me outta town But I hid until the mornin' light Then I burned his sawmill down  I still love that long-haired girl There's a price tag on my head Her daddy owns the county law And if I go back there, I'm dead  So I just dream of Southern roses And miss the love we found Lord, I wish I'd never been born poor Or burnt the sawmill down  It's been years since I left Georgia And I left there on the run They say her daddy's still in a rage Over what I done  He shot at me for lovin' her Thought he run me outta town But I hid until the mornin' light Then I burned his sawmill down  Dirt poor, backwoods, I was was raised Now the lawman's comin' round Mama said I raised a good boy But he burnt the sawmill down  Mama said I raised a good boy But he burnt the sawmill down
*"The Bottom"*Elevator, operator Looks at me and smiles that weary smile I'm sure my looks could easily deceive The very wisest of them all And he says, "Are you goin' to the penthouse Or the condo that lies just beyond The chapel door?" I smile back and softly tell him, "No, I'm headed to the bottom"  I'm goin' all the way down To the bottom So turn the music up real high And let the sweetest Bndictine liqueur flow No need to worry About tomorrow, 'cause you're not there I'm goin' all the way down To the bottom  Rainy streets and wet memories Have found a place inside to pass the time And Pete serves up my whiskey cold And I drink it, and pray the picture fades Dressed in black, you turned your back And broke a heart that loved and loved you so Oh I loved you so The bells rang on the day we died And I headed straight to the bottom  I'm goin' all the way down To the bottom So turn the music up real high And let the sweetest Bndictine liqueur flow There's no need to worry About tomorrow, 'cause you're not there I'm goin' all the way down To the bottom I'm goin' all the way down All the way down All the way down To the bottom
*"Am I The Only One"*Am I the only one here tonight Shakin' my head and thinkin' somethin' ain't right? Is it just me? Am I losin' my mind? Am I standin' on the edge of the end of time?

*"Black"*Shades of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay Were laid spread out before me, as her body once did All five horizons revolved around her soul As the earth to the sun Now the air I tasted and breathed Has taken a turn  Oh... and all I taught her was everything Oh... I know she gave me all that she wore  And now my bitter hands Shake beneath the clouds Of what was everything Oh, the pictures have all been washed in black Tattooed everything  I take a walk outside I'm surrounded by some kids at play I can feel their laughter So why do I swear  Oh... and twisted thoughts that spin round my head I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning How quick the sun can, drop away  And now my bitter hands Cradle broken glass Of what was everything All the pictures have all been washed in black Tattooed everything All the love gone bad Turned my world to black Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all I'll ever be... yeah  I know someday you'll have a beautiful life, I know you'll be a star In somebody else's sky, but why Why, why can't it be, can't it be mine
*"Folded Flag"*When I had seen you You were shining like a diamond in that dress We were young and in love and reckless We were just two kids When I went and signed my name  Now here I am Just a few months later coming home to you I'm flying with my brothers yeah we fought real hard We're all packed up and headed home And if you are reading this there'll come a time real soon When family, friends and flowers fill the room  And two men with starched white gloves Fold the colors 'til they touch It's probably more than I deserve But I'm proud to get this much Sending all the love I ever had Inside this folded flag  Now look at you You're roundin' out but babe you wear it well A little boy or girl it's still too soon to tell Wish I could be there now to hold you both And if you are reading this you probably about to cry Running through your head a questions why  Has two men with starch white gloves Fold the colors 'til they touch It's probably more than I deserve But I'm proud to get this much Sending all the love I ever had Inside this folded flag  It will sit here on the mantle For many years to come And every time you pass it by I hope you feel my love  Two men with starch white gloves Fold the colors 'til they touch Probably more than I deserve But I'm proud to get this much I'm sending all the love I ever had Inside this folded flag Sending all the love I ever had Inside this folded flag

*"I Don't Need You"*Using me everyday Wishing you'd realize and stay But no one is better than him You look at me and you turn away Wishing you'd smile at me everyday But no one is better than him  I don't need you You spit me out again I don't need you You spit me out again  Buy you stuff and it's diamond black You tell me you'll buy me stuff back But you never bought anything for me I take you home from a perfect night You thanked me and then you left my sight But no one is better than you  I don't need you You spit me out again I don't need you You spit me out again

*"I Belong To Her"*I've been brought down to my knees for far too long And the minutes go by without me dragging along And I've been fucked up way too much And I've been shot down way too hard And she's pretty dumb enough to think that I'm a little worthless  But I belong to her And I belong to her I belong to her And I belong to her  I've been brought down to my knees for far too long And the minutes go by without me singing a song I've been drinking up way too much And I've been shooting up way too hard And she's pretty dumb enough to think that I'm a little worthless  But I belong to her And I belong to her I belong to her And I belong to her
*"Stargazers"*It's four A.M at the beach at the beach and I am with you We're away for the night not worried about school Our eyes are red; We're gazing up at the night sky Our bodies' here but we're both floating in space up high Just for the night  Away Away  It's four A.M, it's four A.M, ah, it's four A.M It's four A.M, ah it's four A.M, it's four A.M, ah It's four A.M, it's four A.M, ah, it's four A.M It's four A.M, ah, it's four A.M, it's four A.M, ah It's four A.M, it's four A.M, ah, it's four A.M It's four A.M, ah, it's four A.M, it's four A.M, ah It's four A.M, it's four A.M, ah, it's four A.M It's four A.M, ah, it's four A.M, it's four A.M, ah
*"Hide My Face"*What is the content of love? Look, basically, love is something we can't put our finger on at all. We say, we use such words as warmth, um, tenderness. Uh, all these things, they don't really get to the point. When you're, you're loving somebody you are simply delighting in that person, as such. As if another human organism in its mental and its physical aspects were a piece of music, or a work of art, or a glorious morning  And you go over another person's physical form, and look at it from every possible point of view- and play with it. And uh, that's what it's about. It's the adoration of the form of a human being  And you do, you do that adoring- in terms of physical contacts, that are, say dancing with your fingers across the skin or whatever it may be. This is the nitty gritty, the nub of love- one wants something much more than that. You want to be played with- That's more like it  What is the content of love? It's a sort of it, part of it, it's incidental It's a way of saying very strongly, yes I do want to be with you. But, basically, love is something we can't put our finger on at all  This is Detective Charles checking in. Looks like we have a victim on the ground, gunshot wound to the head. Uh, looks like there's some type of, it's like, it's a recorder... A tape recorder or something... Gonna have to listen to this
*"Summer Is Here"*One, two, three, four  Summer's here and I'm in love with you Doing things that you and me wanna do Alright baby We're smoking up by the pier And we're happy and there's nothing to fear 'Cause summer is here  And we're all alone Come make this party known Let's call our friends on the phone It's better than staying home  Bring the weed and bring all your friends We'll fuck the stars in the sky again and again Alright baby We're shooting up by the pier And we're happy and there's nothing to fear 'Cause summer is here  And we're all alone Come make this party known Let's call our friends on the phone It's better than staying home  So apparently, the tape was for a girlfriend I believe? But, anyways, there appears to be a journal right by the tape recorder and I'm gonna have to give this a read and see what it says
*"What Do I Say?"*Alright, journal entry number one. I don't know where to begin. I guess I could start by talking about the party in the cabin  It was a sunny day, and things were going my way There's a party tonight at 8 If she's there I gotta stay  Her It's her I see, she's all for me Today is the day, but What do I say? What do I say? What do I say to her? I don't know "Hey, how are you?"  "Hey, how are you?" (Distorted background talking) (How are you?...)  So I said those four words to her, we talked outside under the night sky. The party was still going inside. I got her number that night, and we talked about our lives, and everything, pretty much (Oh)  What do I say? What do I say? What do I say to her? I don't know  We both went back inside, and started drinking some more...
*"Drunk Again"*It's one bottle, two, bottle three, bottle four, five bottle six, bottle seven. It's one bottle, two, bottle three, bottle four, seven- eight  Well I'm drunk again Well I'm drunk again I need help with myself, oh I need help with myself... But she's right here  One bottle, two, bottle three, bottle four, five, bottle six, bottle seven. It's one bottle, two, bottle three, bottle four, seven- eight  So after a few more nights of talking to her on the phone, we decided to go to a lake a few days after the party. I honestly think I'm in love with her. I recorded a song for her. It was pretty much about summer and how I was falling for her. I put it on a tape recorder, but, I didn't have the chance to give it to her
*"The Lake Song"*The waves are getting stronger Stronger and stronger it seems Laying towards the corner The water is below our feet  Oh, my hands are getting colder We're both getting shivers it seems The drugs are taking full effect And everything feels like it's a dream It's a dream  Bright lights just lit up the sky and everything that's around Can't tell if it was all real or from the drugs on the ground We just looked at the stars and ecstasy amazes  And at this point, I knew she was the one for me. Even if I knew her, for like, a few weeks. I could tell by the way she talked to me and how I talked to her. Maybe it was destiny? Or that's what I thought, until that drastic moment took place that changed me forever  Oh, how could she do this to poor old me? What did I do to deserve this from her? I don't know, I don't know Oh, how could she do this to poor old me? What did I do to deserve this from her? I don't know, I don't know  She lied to me. I should have known from the very beginning that it was a trap. Why would she go to someone like him? He's not even that great
*"Interlude"*Night has become Academically Plausible, and fashionable This is the way the world works [*distorted sample*]  One, two, three, four!  It's all downhill, there's nothing left for me (Woo!) It's all downhill, there's nothing left for me  Based on all these journal entries, I'm assuming that he got depressed over some girl. But it doesn't say on the journal what exactly she did to him, so... Who knows?
*"He's Just Like The Others"*Can the world be nice for once to me? See the one I care about, get up and leave me The lights dim down in my room, and there goes the sun 'Cause I'm trying to think about why you must go With the other one because  He's just like the others Nothing even special about him Does he fuck well? Does he satisfy? Are you happy? 'Cause as far as I can tell he's like the others But you don't really care  Can you at least be there for me? (Oh) It's 'cause when I'm depressed I do stupid things, so watch after me I won't bother him, I won't bother you Just promise me that he'll never hurt you  He's just like the others Nothing even special about him Does he fuck well? Does he satisfy? Are you happy? 'Cause as far as I can tell he's like the others But you don't really care
*"Overthinking"*Summertime was when we met all drunk at that party She walked away with me that night Since then we hung out daily We held hands and had some fun, but it was ended shortly When what's-his-name came into place And you fell for him slowly  She pushed me away ever since that day with him And I'm at home just sick of shit again  Because I need her But she's already leaving me Because I need her But she's already leaving me But then I need her, and I need her, and I need her bad But she's already leaving me But then I need her But she's already leaving me But oh well  Crazy how life goes on without me Maybe one day I'll find the one to save me But can't you be that person to answer me? But it was all your fault, since you left me  She pushed me away ever since that day with him And I'm at home just sick of the shit again  Because I need her But she's already leaving me Because I need her But she's already leaving me But then I need her, and I need her, and I need her bad But she's already leaving me And I need her But she's already leaving me Because I need her
*"There's No Use In Trying"*There's no use in trying anymore There's no use in trying anymore And I am so lost Can't someone lead me away from the dark?  But there's no use There's no use in trying anymore But there's no use There's no use in trying anymore  'Cause there's no use There's no use In trying anymore In trying anymore But there's no use (You found somebody else) No use (Life will go on without you) In trying anymore In trying anymore 'Cause there's no use (You found somebody else) No use (Life will go on without you) In trying anymore In trying anymore 'Cause there's no (use)
*"Our Rotten Love"*Well this is the last message that you'll ever get from me And I am so sick of it, and I am so sick of it All the bullshit you put me through Again and again It's the same old thing every time  'Cause you left me a little powerless Despite of all bullshit you put me through I did everything for you And you know that  To think for us to be together is all I need You knew that you meant the world to me But what can I say? It's our rotten love It's our rotten love It's our rotten love It's our rotten love It's our rotten love It's our rotten love It's our rotten love It's our rotten love  And that's the last journal entry he wrote, I assume that he took his own life right after he wrote that
*"Die"*And your idea that you're a machine is just a machine, too. So if you're a smart kid, you'd commit suicide. Camus said there is only really one serious philosophical question, which is whether or not to commit suicide. I think there are four or five serious philosophical questions. The first one is, 'Who started it? ' The second is, 'Are we gonna make it? ' The third is, 'Where are we going to put it? ' The fourth is, 'Who's going to clean up? ' And the fifth: 'Is it serious? ' (Hahahaha)  But- but still I-, should you or not commit suicide? This is a good question (Why don't you do it now?). Why go on? And you only go on if the game is worth the gamble (It's so worth it, die.). Now the universe has been going on for an incredibly long time. And so really, a-a satisfactory theory of the universe (Die) - Why bother? Just commit suicide. [Breathing]  But if you want to go on playing the game, you've got to have an optimal theory for playing the game. Otherwise there's no point in it. But the people who coined the fully automatic theory of the universe were playing a very funny game. For what they wanted to say was this: (You're worthless to her, and to the world, you're worthless, and I could be flying away into the sunset, and to earth, and to peace, and it seems that, come on, now) "All you people who believe in religion -old ladies and wishful thinkers. You've got a big daddy up there, And you want comfort thing, but life is rough. Life is tough, as success goes to the most hard-headed people..." (Tell me how you feel)  So if you think that's the way things are You may as well commit suicide right now (Girl, tell me, and I love you) You may as well commit suicide right now You may as well commit suicide right now (Tell me) You may as well commit suicide right now (And I don't have to do this) You may as well commit suicide right now You may as well commit suicide right now You may as well commit suicide right now ('Cause I'm just at the last) You may as well commit suicide right now (Thread) You may as well commit suicide right now You may as well commit suicide right now You may as well commit suicide right now (I'm gonna take my own life) You may as well commit suicide right now (Don't do it) You may as well commit suicide right now [*indecipherable screeching*] You may as well commit suicide right now You may as well commit suicide right now (Don't go!) You may as well commit suicide right now (I'm sorry, bro) You may as well commit suicide right now [*cocks gun*] You may as well commit suicide right now [*gunshot*]  [*police sirens and communication device samples playing*]  [*cassette tape ejecting*] "Ah, wasn't that relaxing darlin'? Ahyuk! "
*"Sandy Kim"*Could be worthless Can it mean something more? Could be worthless Can it mean something more? Could be worthless Can it mean something more? Could be worthless Can it mean something more?
*"Best Friend"*She's 18, really nice Gets coffee every night She smokes a stoge then she cries Then I gaze right into her eyes And I ask her "why are you crying tonight?" She said she broke up with him  She takes me home, to her house Then we sit right on the couch She tells me what happened Then she tells me they are finished I apologized, I gazed right into her eyes She smiled at me and she said "Be my best friend"
*"Mikey's Song"*Toast girl and me chillin at the mill Feeding me toast, getting me filled Next thing I know I'm staring at her eyes And now I got my hand between her thighs  She's my toast girl She's my toast girl  Toast girl and me, making out at the mill She's got a boyfriend, I might get killed She told me it's time, time to go But just one second let me finish my toast girl
*"Aly's Song"*I don't think I should call you a friend You're just someone I know But I don't wanna know Know you anymore  Crazy thoughts Through the night Forget it all Out of your sight Wish I could be In your mind Instead I'm Out of your sight  I didn't need you You didn't care I should've left you It wasn't fair  How can you do that Broke my heart You played me From the start
*"New York"*(Oooh, Oooh) Can we run to the city that we call home? Where needles comes pleasure with a sensual call Stone bricks lay forth on the pavement floor Bright lights, loud noise we hear when we fall  Can we run to the city that we call home? Where needles comes pleasure with a sensual call Stone bricks lay forth on the pavement floor Bright lights, loud noise we hear when we fall  Can we run to the city that we call home? Where needles comes pleasure with a sensual call Stone bricks lay forth on the pavement floor
*"Ayce's Song"*Feeling empty Push back the light Something morbid Chaotic, seems right  And these lucid dreams are turning real Darkness creeps, your kiss I feel And everything just doesn't feel real  And I doubt I cry And I shout (shout!) In my mind  Then I push you away and now we're not okay And we're stuck in this loop in a matter of days I hurt you, what did I do? 'Cus when I felt your embrace and it felt out of place I fake a smile on my face And tell you were all okay?

*"Life"*[Interviewer:] People think of you as the, um, the perfect "pop artist," without really knowing what that means, or I think knowing what your work is is about. I'd like to try to talk some more about the paintings, and the things you did earlier, uh, because there's something that needs to be explained for the public which has- at this point- a certain impression of you, and I'm not sure it's the one that you would want them to have, although, I don't think it matters to you very much, is that true?

*"Dilemma"*Five, four, three, two, one  Out of sunshine There's nowhere to go Look in my eyes Try to find what you found before  And is it old me gazing right at you? And is it old me trying someway to prove that  I still care And that I fucked up But can we please move on? Or am I not enough? But then, I still care I know I fucked it up But can we work it out?

*"kiss/love/flat"*My first crush happened when I was 5 So I gave him a glittered valentine He laughed and proved why a crush is a crush I cried all the way home on the bus  My first kiss happened at the top of the stairs Near the lockers and the science layer He pulled me in with such a rush I'm going to miss my bus  My first love fell pretty flat After some time I didn't want to deal with that It became more of an obligation and a fuss Like how I almost my bus
*"to my friends"*I feel good in this room with you (and you) And I feel confided that this is how I was always supposed to feel That someone was savin' it for me So I would appreciate it  I writhed for explanations alone in my bedroom I sat in disbelief convinced that it was all going to shit I had fake people to help me They sad  Wait for it, you'll feel better  I feel good in this room with you (and you) And of course you

I don't know if my mom loves me anymore She says that I am changing, I am not what she bargained for I set fire to abusers like a war, I am a terror But I don't know what it is I fight for  And I cure the pores of my skin I leave no room for anything I survive because I have died And I cure the pores of my skin I leave no room for anything I survive because I have died  And just to keep my head afloat and my body unprovoked I set up walls but make sure to include windows And just to keep my head afloat and my body unprovoked I set up walls but make sure to include windows  And I cure the pores of my skin I leave no room for anything I survive because I have died And I cure the pores of my skin I leave no room for anything I survive because I have died  And maybe in a year, I will learn to love the fear And maybe in a year, I will not feel like a bad queer

I spent years ashamed of myself Scared to cut the bad shit out of my life Cause what is left when the bad is gone? I thought I'd be alone with no reason why  And it is okay to feel doubt! But just know you're gonna find a way out!  (Oooh)
*"Sorry I Was Sorry"*Sorry for asking you to love me more Guess I've become the burden I was so fearful of before Never asking you to make me frozen mac n' cheese Never asking to sleep in your bed unless you begged me "please"  Sorry for writing all those love songs for you Is that suffocating to you too? Guess I'll throw out my valentine's if that's the only thing to do You'll fish out the one's you like But I bet my words would be misconstrued  Sorry we couldn't work it out, and I couldn't help to want you Sorry you were cozy in a place of not wanting me too  What else am I to do?

*"Sincerely Yours, Truly"*You know you broke the rules, you know you were very cruel Somehow you felt you were going to fall in love with me  Eventually  Bullshit, I'm not some fantasy But you keep saying that you miss me I can't accept that you were going to fall in love at all  I know I'm acting tough The truth is that I am not I still have dreams of us And now I don't want love at all
*"Laying On My Floor"*I guess I shoulda known it was gonna happen this way I should have never called you up in the first place And I guess my head's always spinnin' in the same way And I guess I will just be sad today  (Ooh)  And my dad says, "why do you always fight, for love that always bites?"

You put me on leave
*"Wake"*I wake to empty space in my head Well if I cried and I tried to feel fed Tell me, would you love me instead of getting lower in your head?  Just know, if I ever think of you Oh I do not, no I do not want to  And If I slept without you then I can surely do it again And If you let me go then You will surely do it again

*"Lose/Recover"*Had a dream I was underground To a point, I stopped trying to get found Clawed my way out and filled the hole With flower seeds and much richer soil  Looked at myself closely in the mirror Took the dark parts out that were causing this fever Replaced them with one large oak seed Realized then I was just trying to get green  Yeah I lost love, love does what it does Thought I lost me, but there I was!  Thought I lost me, but it came to be A momentary lapse of happily
*"Ephemeralness"*I've seen All of this aching root and leave I am clear now Keep me safe, please  When I, when I feel like nothing Please tell me that I am something And I'll believe you instead  Light breeze Nine in the morning Black socks on feet Love that leaves Specks on sweaty feet  If you, if you feel like nothing I'll tell you that you are something And you'll believe me instead
*"Full Screen"*Do you full screen your porn? Do you think about me As you watch her crawl across the floor? Oh, oh, oh And in romantic comedies Do you project my genderless body Onto the girl Who loves you for what you were?  What about me? Will I be seen? Will I be seen?  If I was something else Would you let me feel the weight of this pose? I'll grip my hands to my head Just to see how far this goes  And I loved you more Than I wanted to But she says that we Just don't get to choose No, we don't get to choose  And I wasted the warmer months Feeling sad about you But nature doesn't get to choose
*"J Station"*One more time for old sake I meet you by the BYOB place on Avenue A A little drunk, stopped for donuts And I got robbed by the J Station I labeled you as a bad omen  Did you see me hide under my scarf to cry As you rubbed my back and said "You look beautiful tonight"  Drive me home through Jersey And I'll pretend that the song you played Wasn't meant for me and me only  So I will rest or maybe put on my shoes And I'll regress to 12 AM calls that hurt you too  One more song for old sake I'll be sad you were ever in my life in the first place
*"Patience"*You yell at cars in the street And I laugh and say "I love your energy" And sometimes, when we're walking You are further ahead of me And you step back to meet me And I love your speed  It is what I think about It is what I think about It is what I think about In the mornin' When you are not around  Sometimes, when we are walking I can only mention trees And you laugh and say "I love the way you need To point out everything you see"  Is it what you think about Is it what you think about Is it what you think about In the mornin' When I am not around  And you yell at cars in the street But you, you are Patient with me And I know I know I am distracted easily But sometimes, I swear You are the only thing I see  It is what we think about It is what we think about It is what we think about In the mornin' When we are not around
*"Tenderness"*I reached down and found the wrong Parts that's been stripped down I beckoned you my tender one Cooed you to respect its roundness Take a hard hit And be careful with this I feel softness in your eyes The warmth of brown I feel softness everywhere Soft spots that need to be found And take a hard stand And you extend your hand And cradle my tenderness
*"Same"*I walk back to the place where I lost it And these places remain all the same You tell me anger is not good for the body And you say I changed But who's to blame? Oh, I will Hate you until I am still Oh, I will Embrace the ways I still stay the same And you took a hard squeeze At the soft spots of my body And these spots will remain Touched in vain And oh, I will Apologize until I am ill And oh, I will Take the blame And you will stay the same
*"Steal The Lake From The Water"*Call it what you want I see myself under water You call drowning swimming As you watch me swallow water Forget what I said I emerge wet and screaming bloody murder And you might say I make myself Into a marginal victim A baby crying hard until I get what I want But there is a friction between What I want and what I need And it is clear that I must scream So I paddle harder Pain exists in ways you inflict The breaks you can't solder Write about me Live in your own world of hurt Steal the lake from the water And I'll conflate the ones who Made me feel a part of their system Every screaming man gets what He wants and doesn't know the difference Between what he wants and thinks he needs And I always find myself to be The loving martyr I'm screaming like thunder
*"Drive Me Home"*Drive me home, drive me home, drive me home Take me home I feel a mess, I feel a mess I feel like I could blow Blow away Take me away And if you wanna stay You can stay to find my shape Ooh If I'm a man If I'm a man will you hate me? And If I'm good If I'm good will you validate me? And the selfish ways I claim my space And the violent ways space I can't make I am pushed into a place I can't breathe I can't tell if the want justifies the need Ooh If I am good If I am good If I am good If I am really fucking good Will you (please take me home) Validate me And create the space I can't make
*"First Day Of Spring"*It snowed a week ago On the first day of spring Like me it was not ready for The warmth despite all its waiting I have not felt cold enough I don't want the gift But I do so much She called for me two months ago I wish I was thawed I'll give you all of me But right now it isn't much And the sun burns too hot I burn myself too hot The slap of winter is too much Too much To recover
*"Passenger"*You're a passenger in my car But just the pretended parts That I sing to in the dark You're a lover, I am not And that's why I loved you That's why I loved you That's why I loved you  When I started to fall out of love Put my arms out extended And tried to catch it all When I finally opened my hands up I'm sorry, I wasn't fast enough  Do you remember Your hand on my shoulder In the car in December Driving to my parent's house On the cusp of the state line New England to Westchester On the cusp of loving And resenting each other  I was a passenger in your car And now I'm ghost who won't Answer a call I was a lover that you were not And that's why I left you That's why I loved you That's why I loved you
*"Wisconsin"*Last night I dreamt I was still in love with her and It felt funny, strange, like deja vu To you again, how weird  Last night our knees kissed On the couch of your parent's basement Your arm brushed mine as you Reaching over me to grab your water  What does that mean? Do you want me? I've seen light creep Out the sides of your eyes At midnight  The other day we drove through Wisconsin And I was not afraid Have you ever seen grass so green I'd like to show you many things  What would it mean If I did need it? Sometimes I think That I don't need it And then my phone blinks A message from you "Hello again"
*"Breathing"*I am isolating, I get my communication  From an overdue hospital bill I can't afford to pay so I hide it Under a stack of things I'd rather not  Yet deal with I bury into another show  Stream into my head and eyes  Watch as I die  Touch and go My finger's on my pulse My hands are stretched Underneath my nose  Watch me fold My finger's on the response message  Watching the cursor float  I am isolating in every corner of my house  It's not pretty and it feels like I'm locked In myself Did you expect me to get on my knees And beg for you? Let's cut a deal  Let me know If I'm alive or if I've choked I can't see your face So I just go and guess if I'm breathing   Touch and go My finger's on my pulse My hands are stretched Underneath my nose  To see if I'm breathing  I take a step and collapse I'll never understand it I'll never see you again Is this the way you planned it?  I take a step and collapse I'll never understand it I'll never see you again Is this the way you planned it?  I take a step and collapse I'll never understand it I'll never see you again Is this the way you planned it?

*"Berlin"*You flee when it's hard And I stay put You say you're a bird But you're flying East for winter And I wont tell you not to go You won't hear it anyway But what are you going towards?

*"Sober"*You've been sober now For a few days and I bet that it helps You to not send me a text That says you love me still  And the only thing that I've done This month is drink beer and Masturbate, and ignore Phone calls from you What else am I supposed to do?  Because the last image of you I remember Is your hunched over back on the side of the bed Telling me that I shouldn't leave  And I didn't wanna lie I guess When you asked me if I loved you less In the passenger side of my car So I didn't respond  And the last image of me you remember Is my hunched over back on the driver's side Begging you to get out when you said that You wanted to die Can't you see that's the kind of shit that I can't be the one to decide? But if you asked me now, I'd want you alive  And it's a chilling confidence That I don't need you anymore But you knew that, I'm sure Honesty broke the glass of the bottle That I struck at the door When I couldn't do this any longer Now I don't even think of you When I am sober  Now I don't even think of you When I am sober
*"Dancing"*I'm dancing to The song I crashed my car to Feel something new Fall in love with an old tune  And I fall back down to Fall away from you And I get back up to Shoot myself into the moon  And I try hard I Flirt heavy with life To one day makeout with it I am trying my best Block out the thought of I'm the one you hate and The one you love  Conclude with force  I can't be the one you hate And the one that you love I can't be the one you hate And the one that you love I can't be the one you hate And the one you love

We were barefoot in the mudpath on the backside of the house If I was a little older I'd hold your hand and not feel any doubt I think about the time that I missed being a kid feeling like this Feeling like I was in an abyss right now  I think about myself making lists of how I'm shit God I can be so relentless But at least I'm not afraid anymore I think And I'm dancing in the light with my friends While "I Will Survive" plays over the P.A And I look across the room  I see the girl I want to kiss But I'm not sure if she wants to kiss But at least I can ask without feeling like shit
*"Regret It"*I was amazed You would treat me this way I thought you were a grace Thought you were a saint  And now it just hurts To think of you that way Cut my lip on the tip Of the silence you give You admit it's a presence But you won't give me napkin For the blood, I thought You'd always stay put  And I'm counting down the days I won't hear your name I've had a good year without you But it's always the same  Feeling ashamed, or worse Sorry for the hurt That I never performed But sure I still love you the same Won't tell you this anyway  I don't care anymore Go and do your own shit The relationship I still pull a thread of it The woman I love The woman I'll never call again  Don't make me regret it Don't make me regret it Don't make me regret it
*"Checking Up"*Thick snow, I fall down in it slow  I retreat to its pillow  Snot gets smudged Swept on my cheek No tissue, especially not you  You tell me that you're not  Checking up on me But I am the one you think of when  You think about the things You've done wrong before In your life  You call me when you're out on the road  You just met someone reminds you of me  And I'll appear in your shadows And you'll say I need To think about the things I want before I Kiss your thick light  Goodbye  And all of our guilt Is collectivized in ill written iPhone notes And I do not want you to know You are the one I think of when  I think about the things That I've done wrong before  You are the one I think of when  I think about the things That I've fucked up before  In my life

No, not in this world No, not in the next No, not in my wildest dreams  They recommended euthanasia For non-conformists anywhere Some men's dreams for others turn to nightmares This never would have happened in my  [Chorus] Fly away...

*"Without You"*Gazing at our sunrise Reflected in your clear eyes Misty morning forest smoke fires  Make our way through the broken day I couldn't stand to stay Without you  We must keep moving While the light is clearing Leaving your dark world behind you  You have to run Life is just begun I'll never be alone Without you  One chilling thought Come screaming through the dark I saw a yellow moon at midnight  And now you woke Glowing in the smoke I'm suddenly alone Without you  Wanting things the way they used to be You don't know what that can do to me One more day, maybe never Might as well be forever  Outside the light, fading as I write And another night reminds me  As I sleep, memory that I keep It's just another day Without you  It seems so long I've been holding on Since I felt my arms around you  Time will go, both of us will know Never be a day Without you
*"Cutting It Fine"*The door swings open but you won't go it You hate the movie that you haven't seen You couldn't see what I have in mind I see you laughing but you're Cutting it, cutting it fine  You never should have done those things to me There's one thread left 'tween you and history And while our temperature is rising high I'm warning you that you are Cutting it, cutting it fine  Cutting it, cutting it fine...  You gambled all on one important game Now take the debt and don't complain Your game was up, I saw it all the time I saw that vice, girl, you're Cutting it, cutting it fine  Your sole advisor watch out for yourself You never listen to anyone else You were the one who ignored the signs Dancing on a fine line Cutting it, cutting it fine  Cutting it, cutting it fine...

That sound, still ringing in my ears From a decade ago Around, around my head, the sound from my radio I thought, that after all these years The tears, the growing fears That I would never hear Never again  Voice of America, ooh, America Voice of America, ooh, America
*"Hard On Me"*A secret smile Comes to my eyes like a bolt from the blue It's not your style But it leads me to dream about what we could do  Could it be the same (Could it be the same) Ever be the same (When I call your name) Could it be the same again Ever the same again?  It's hard on me And I know, nothing comes easy But it's hard on you Believe me, baby it's hard on me  A trick of light Your face in the shadows alone in the night You're in my sights All I've been thinking I know that it's right  See you standing there (See you standing there) Magic in the air (Magic in the air) Now the smoke has cleared Time has disappeared  It's hard on me But you know, nothing comes easy But it's hard on you I need you, always believe me  Could it be the same? (Could it be the same) Ever be the same (When I call your name) Could it be the same Ever the same again?  It's hard on me But I know, nothing comes easy But it's hard on you I need you, always believe me  It's hard on me But you know, nothing comes easy But it's hard on you I've hurt you before Now please don't make it hard on me
*"Wishing"*Wishing, hoping How can I keep coping? Till I know your wish is to be with me  You go, I know You were the one who told me so I'm wishing you lying in my arms again  Sad, so sad It's written across my face My tears leave no trace They fall and disappear  Mad, so mad Leaving you on your own You're right to disown me Will always be so clear  Wishing, so long How can I keep holding on? While missing you, wishing you home again  Sad, so sad It's written across my face My tears leave no trace They fall and disappear  Mad, so mad Leaving you on your own You're right to disown me Will always be so clear  Wishing...
*"Rock And Roll Dream"*[Chorus:] Rock and roll dream Not what it seems Who is the dreamer now?  When I see the faces from the limousine No chance of our survival Armed forces, guardians of the law Awaiting our arrival  They all are young We all were young And I've seen this place before Open up the door Let us in  All the things I've seen Words I said, I didn't mean Feelings, I took for granted But now reality One thing we could never see Everything, we always wanted  They all are young We all were young And I've seen this place before Open up the door Let us in  [Chorus]  If I had the choice Words came through my voice I should have left unspoken Now it's obvious Clear to all of us The dream that now is broken  Take the stage tonight Go face the lights With this image you should keep You're crying in your sleep Tonight  [Chorus]
*"Countdown To Zero"*The night is cold, the sun is down I see faces through the wire No chance for them No shoulder left to cry on  It's 4 am out on the street Through the smoke I see the fire It's a funeral pyre For them to die on  [Chorus:] Countdown to zero Just begun Countdown to zero It's time to start the run  The city lights are fading now As I climb into the plane To shield me from The stinging acid rain  And this is it, it's over now As we taxi down Runway One Tell me please You'll wake me when it's over  [Chorus]  Do you realize what's happening in Western Europe? Norway, Finland, Scotland, England We will be the first to go Don't do it  [Chorus]  Don't do it Don't do it Don't start the countdown to zero We want to live We want to live We will live You've got your finger on the trigger Take it off Let it go Let it pass Let it go
*"Love Now Till Eternity"*Now, the party's over It's you and I, just you and I Now, the guests have gone It's one on one, one on one  Which way now, will the eagle fly? Tell me how, will the starts shine in the sky  [Chorus:] Love now till eternity Shooting for the moon To put your hand in mine and say I vow to stay with you  [Chorus]  You, you are my life And so I give, all that I can All, all that is left That you are woman, I am man  Which way now, will the eagle fly? Tell me how, will the starts shine in the sky  [Chorus]
*"Too Late"*I say, no way You've gone and stepped across that fine line I cried, you lied I tried, maybe a thousand times before I can't take no more  [Chorus:] Too late You let the sun go down Too late You changed direction Too late For you to turn around We tried everything  Move on, so long Two side to every story You told, good nights bad days, time to go out separate ways I can't say no more  [Chorus x2]
*"Suspicion"*Where were you yesterday? I called you up No one answered  The phone rings now All the time I pick it up No one answers  I know it seems like I just can't go ahead Sometimes it's like holding a gun to my head I get the green light but I'm still seeing red Something I can't stand  Suspicion Suspicion  In the park, yesterday I saw a face that spelled danger A friendly smile, a worried look I mistook for a stranger  I keep on fighting and I know I can't win Something's biting me I'll never give in Coming back to me again and again The message in my hand  Suspicion Suspicion  Eating away at me, it won't let go Suspicion is following, everywhere I go He walks before me, he's someone that I don't know  Suspicion Suspicion  Where were you yesterday? Where will you be tomorrow?
*"After The War"*For those that are able To go underground Missiles disenable They hit faster than sound They're coming and you have no choice The helpless with one human voice That will categorically say This underdog will have his day  One more dead is one more than it ought to be A travesty One more missed will be kissed to eternity Or purgatory  After the war  Red button he's pressing But he knows not why He's programming orders War lights up the sky He's on the hotline tonight His mind is high as a kite His fingers decide wrong or right This man has it all in his sights  Used as tools to believe in autonomy Minorities are no more Men are fools, one last cry to humanity No sanity any more  After the war  On my arm, a tattoo for my sons to be That numbers you and me There's a scar on my face That is photographed for all to see  After the war
*"Only Time Will Tell"*You're leaving now It's in your eyes There's no disguising it It really comes as no surprise To find that you planned it all along  I see it now Becomes so clear Your insincerity And me all starrey-eyed You'd think that I would have known by now  [Chorus:] Now, sure as the sun will cross the sky This lie is over Lost, like the tears that used to tide me over  (Only time will tell) One thing is sure That time will tell (Only time will tell) If you were wrong The brightest ring around the moon Will darken when I die  [Chorus]  [Repeat first verse] [Repeat second verse] [Chorus]  (Only time will tell) You're on your own Inside your room (Only time will tell) You're claiming victory You were just using me And there is no one you can use now  (Only time will tell) One thing is sure That time will tell...
*"Heat Of The Moment"*I never meant to be so bad to you One thing I said that I would never do A look from you and I would fall from grace And that would wipe the smile right from my face  Do you remember when we used to dance And incidents arose from circumstance? One thing led to another, we were young And we would scream together songs unsung  It was the heat of the moment Telling me what my heart meant The heat of the moment shone in your eyes  And now you find yourself in '82 The disco hot-spots hold no charm for you You can't concern yourself with bigger things You catch the pearl and ride the dragon's wings  'Cause it's the heat of the moment The heat of the moment The heat of the moment shone in your eyes  And when your looks are gone and you're alone How many nights you sit beside the phone? What were the things you wanted for yourself? Teenage ambition you remember well  It was the heat of the moment Telling you what your heart meant The heat of the moment shone in your eyes  It was the heat of the moment Heat of the moment Heat of the moment shone in your eyes  Heat of the moment Heat of the moment Heat of the moment  Heat of the moment Heat of the moment Heat of the moment
*"Wildest Dreams"*They decorated all the generals Who fought the wars behind the lines They had forgotten all the soldiers The brandy put them way behind the times  Insanity has found its way to TV screens Vision seems impossible to me They fight (they fight) for king (for king) and country I never would have thought this in my  [Chorus:] Wildest dreams Wildest dreams Wildest dreams Wildest dreams  The evening comes, we sit and watch the VJs Clips and rushes come from who knows where From Washington across to California With fighting breaking out in Leicester Square  We see the soldiers moving on to victory And children trampled under marching feet They fight (they fight) for king (for king) and country How many millions will they put to sleep?  [Chorus] Fly away...  No, not in this world No, not in the next No, not in my wildest dreams  They recommended euthanasia For non-conformists anywhere Some men's dreams for others turn to nightmares This never would have happened in my  [Chorus] Fly away...  No, not in this world No, not in the next No, not in my wildest dreams...
*"Don't Cry"*Hard times you had before you I knew when I first saw you You girl you've always been mistreated, cheated  So leave it all behind you It took so long to find you I know that we can last forever, ever and more, more, oh  Don't Cry now that I've found you Don't Cry take a look around you Don't Cry it took so long to find you Do what you want, but little darling please Don't Cry  I knew I'd never doubt it I was so sure about it Don't think of all that's been before  I'll hear you when you're calling I'll catch you when you're falling Don't worry I will always be there, like never before, or, oh
*"The Smile Has Left Your Eyes"*I saw you standing hand in hand And now you come to me the solitary man And I know what it is that made us live Such ordinary lives The where to go the who to see No one could sympathize The Smile Has Left Your Eyes The Smile Has Left Your Eyes  And I've become a rolling stone I don't know where to go or what to call my own But I can see that black horizon glooming ever close to view It's over now it's not my fault See how this feels for you The Smile Has Left Your Eyes The Smile Has Left Your Eyes  But I never thought I'd see you Standing there with him So don't come crawling back to me  Now it's too late you realized Now there's no one can sympathize Now that the Smile Has Left Your Eyes Now it's too late you realized Now there's no one can sympathize Now it's too late you realized Now that the Smile Has Left Your Eyes
*"Days Like These"*The sun was shining The sky was crying It just tore apart And down came the rain  And I was soaking Yeah I was freezing But I was feeling No kind of pain  Come a fireball I held it in my hand You see before you A man who's known greatness  I had a vision A revelation I took a look inside of me And I am a sensation  Days like these I feel like I can change the world [repeat]  It's either easy Or it's impossible And if you ain't got it You ain't never gonna get it  But once you find it You gotta grab it Reach down your own throat And yank it to the surface  That may be brutal May be gory But whatever else it is It's my story  And I believe it Yeah, I can see it I sing it out, shout it out Gimme death or glory  [Chorus]  Days like these, days like these I think I'll move a mountain or two Days like these, days like these Anything you want you know I'll get it for you  The sun was shining I was crying I saw a thousand people Singing in the rain  And I was thinking About the Indians And how they say true wisdom Only comes from pain  Come a rumbling Humbling feeling Like things will never Ever be the same  But what doesn't kill you Only makes you stronger Today I'm strong enough And anyway, I love the rain  [Chorus]
*"Prayin' 4 A Miracle"*I've been flat out of luck Spent my very last buck Can't sink no lower than this I'm so broken inside Had to spit out my pride This ain't no way to exist  Every place that I go Everyone that I meet Sees me like I'm some dog in the street And it's bringin' me down to my knees  Now I'm prayin', prayin' Prayin' for a miracle I'm prayin', prayin' Prayin' for a miracle Prayin' for a miracle  Since I left you that night Less than nothing's gone right Living this hell that I made So I'm back at your feet I'm admitting defeat Girl, I never felt so afraid  Just give back my life I admit my mistakes Now I'm willing to do whatever it takes I'm begging you now, can't you see  That I'm prayin', prayin' Prayin' for a miracle Prayin', prayin' Prayin' for a miracle Prayin' for a miracle  Don't walk away 'Cause I know I'm still worth savin' Can you forgive the way I turned my back on you And I'm prayin', prayin' Prayin' for a miracle  Prayin', prayin' Prayin' for a miracle ...
*"Am I In Love?"*Standing there I've been watching you All alone Your face says it all Desperately I need to talk to you Can you see me Will you answer my call  Am I In Love Or is it the magic of tonight Am I In Love Or is it the magic of tonight And will it be right Tomorrow morning  Hold me now I feel you close to me It's so good, so good I want more Something stirs Deep inside of me Face to face as we move My life is yours  Just one kiss Remember this And it will stay with you Forever
*"Summer"*Her fingers feel the air The mantle now so bare From green then into brown Lie scattered all around We hope they will return Like those before did learn Now that their summer's gone We have to carry on  Till we rise, I just can't wait Now tell me, who are you To judge my fate?  [Chorus:] Oh, the rain burns on Now that summer's gone Oh, the wind blows strong Now that summer's gone  Across the fields we ran To emerald castles, banned By rule of modern man Who built a winterland Then as the seasons change He'll fly and hide away Above a cloud of words On wings of gold I heard  We must rise, it's not too late Now tell me, who are you To change our fate?  [Chorus]
*"Voice Of America"*I heard you on the radio Some other time From some forgotten studio Way down the line So long, so long I've waited now To hear you again That song, that song will still remain Become an old friend And now, the tears are in my eyes The sound you can't disguise The truth comes back from lies And all I want to hear  Voice of America, ooh, America Voice of America, ooh, America  And then you came in stereo Calling to me And so I watch the videos Across the T.V. That sound, still ringing in my ears From a decade ago Around, around my head, the sound from my radio I thought, that after all these years The tears, the growing fears That I would never hear Never again  Voice of America, ooh, America Voice of America, ooh, America
*"Who Will Stop The Rain?"*This problem is insoluble The answers seem impossible The logic ceases to exist Emotion is the beat we miss  I stand on a world Where dreams, realities, existence are the same We take from the mother's skin But the world is not to blame  Who tells the wind which way to blow? I wonder who will stop the rain The rocks that hold the secrets, they don't know So who can stop the rain? We've lost the path for all we know Now tell me when will it start again? And as the old man lifts his hands Please can you stop the rain?  Stars fall far away Like they never did before A new moon shining Like it never will again  Desert white cloud Spirits they sing Rain falls from the big sky Onto broken wing  There is no sense in turning back To wash the debris from the track World without fears without rhyme We fought for peace within our time
*"Lay Down Your Arms"*We used to live in a better world Where sky and water were free We point the finger We point the gun Is that the way it should be?  We rape the land And we tear the skin Burn the blood In the stone To fuel the fire of a selfish mind Do you want to live here alone?  Lay down your arms - surrender You know you'll never get out of here Lay down your arms - remember No force - you'd better lay down your gun  Such are the sins of humanity Dark is the air that we breathe A war to hide in society Don't close your eyes to deceive  Too many promises Too may tears Where does the future lie If we burn away the years  We can make this a better world Where sky and water are free So give the hand without the gun That's the way it will be
*"Heaven On Earth"*I am caught in the heat Hold your head as you sleep How can I close my eyes watching you Such a fever inside from emotions within Burning the night with the truth  Sweetest poison - positive attraction Raging in my mind  Oh if you walk away You'll take the life from me Oh if you walk away You'll take the air I breathe Life would be lonely More than you'll ever know 'Cos you've put all heaven on earth  I hear the sound of your voice On the breach of the wind I feel the touch of an angel Next to my skin It cuts so deep inside It draws out the life Harder with every time  Sweetest poison - positive attraction Raging in my mind
*"Someday"*Don't want to live in another world Don't want to dream of another girl That's the way it was meant to be  I couldn't sleep through the lonely night I just cried till the morning It's not the way it was meant to be  Someday you may find somebody else Someday love my shine on you Someday you may find the one  You didn't leave me, you ran away Couldn't face what you had to say It's not the way it was meant to be  Now you can live in your other world Me, I've found me another girl And that's the way it was meant to be  When I dream, I dream of one world But I know there's no such place If I could ever find that one girl In my world, in my world
*"Crime Of The Heart"*Dreams that have melted now frozen like statues Under the surface here lies the unknown Love has a way of disguising its purpose Seeing your pain my hand goes out to you  You should have known better than to trust him How the pain shines through your eyes  Nothing hits harder than a crime of the heart It breaks you up and it tears you apart You just want to die, you've been so abused Now you know how it feels to be used Nothing hurts harder than a crime of the heart I'm such a fool, I should have known from the start I saw it coming and I feel I'm to blame But love don't give in  I watch your face as you stare into distance Eyes filled with tears that look so far away Deep in your heart can you feel a resistance? Love it just happens there's no-one to blame  You should have known better than to sacrifice The stained-glass soul you hide  Nothing hits harder than a crime of the heart It's the kind of feeling that pulls you apart There's no where to run, there's nothing to say You never knew that you could feel this way Nothing hurts harder than a crime of the heart I could have told you he was wrong from the start I'm not guilty, but I feel I'm to blame My love won't give in  Crime of the heart
*"A Far Cry"*In the dead of night On the wings of the wind I hear the ocean bell With a flash of light In the beat of the dark The sound I know so well  I shall never forget you It's been so long I should never have left you The call so strong  It's a far cry from a wild world It want to get back to you Such a long road, to the homeland I must make my way to a far cry  From the chords of the earth To the depths of the sea I will return As I look to the hill Through the eyes of the storm I touch the flame  I shall never forget you It's been so long I should never have left you The call so strong  It's such a far cry
*"Back In Town"*Wheels turn - smoke rise Chrome wings - low ride Freeway - red line To city lights electric I glide If there's escape from your illusion You gotta break the whole constitution  Concrete - touch sky Main street - dogs lie Steel bird - black tie Is this what they call the freedom you buy? Look at him behind the delusion All you hear is the voice of confusion  The bad boy's back The bad boy's back in town The bad boy's back Don't you shoot him down  Wheels spin - ace high No win - no life One world - truth lies Love's just a word on a red neon sign If there's escape from the conclusion You gotta shake the whole institution  If there's escape from your illusion You gotta break the whole constitution
*"Don't Call Me"*You know I'll never understand your reasons I gave you all the love that I could give Now I'm sitting on a plane to take me far away I've got to find a new place to live  It used to feel so good when you stood beside me How can you forget the words you said? Things like: I'm gonna stay with you forever Will always echo in my head  Don't call me, don't call me, no more  If this plane ride lasts forever I couldn't quite get over you We spent too much time together I can't believe we're through  Don't call me, don't call me, no more
*"Love Under Fire"*Love under fire We stand in the flame Now and forever After the rain When is forever? You can take it from me It may be never C'est la vie  Love under fire And we stand in the flame Now and forever After the rain When is forever? You can take it from me It may be never Just wait and see  You can hide in the jungle You can climb up a tree You can scan the horizon Tell me what you see? As cold as a mountain With a heart that can freeze There's a storm on the water With every heart that she seas  Love under fire
*"The Voice Of Reason"*Nothing ventured nothing gained Tired and washed out by the pain Do we share this problem, will it slip away? Or do we fight another day? Was I looking for a friend? One I could on 'til the end Is there something that I didn't do? Does it all begin with you?  So how did I, Oh I Give you reason? But how did I, Oh I Give you reason?  After all the fallen tears When we wake the token dream Who let the water slowly draw away? All the colours we made  To give you reason, to change the river's flow To give you reason, to point the bone To give you reason, to set your spirit free I don't know, I don't know why  Is there nothing I can say? Is there nothing I can do, girl? Didn't mean to break your life Didn't mean to burn your world, no  You can keep the silver band You can have the memories, girl Now as 'Pilate' cleans the hands It's no more to do with me, no  So how did I, Oh I Give you reason? Let's the voice of reason say:
*"Little Rich Boy"*Don't read "Marx" He's a clean cut guy Just the dream On a TV eye If you swim In the dark You lose a hand When you feed the shark  Little rich boy, she's gonna find you Little rich boy Little rich boy, those claws will blind you Just a little rich boy  She got hooks In your veins Feel the pleasure Kill the pain Drop a pearl See the dragon fly Crack the diamond Do you still feel high?
*"Anytime"*As a child, we played the game Fought the war, but felt no pain Arm to arm, we left the skin Then said the words, remember them  Oh, never a moments doubt Oh, feel it, scream it loud  [Chorus:] Anytime that you call Anytime if you fall Anytime I'll be there for you Any moment of fear Anytime say the prayer Swear that our word is true  Should I go Should I stay? I won't turn my head away Cross the line, the great divide So kill the silence, where we hide  Oh, never a moments doubt Oh, feel it so scream it loud  [Chorus]  If clouds fall, stand tall As mountains climb from endless sea Call out, fear not Bring back that memory  [Chorus]
*"Are You Big Enough"*Walked the streets at night Head low To cross the borderline That only you know Then inside your room You'll show The man you did not want to be  [Chorus:] Are you big enough? Are you losing your touch? And if you walk away Don't you know you'd better change  From these early days Don't want to let go You'd climb the stairs of change To her room Held those clothes so soft Was it so good To paint the face the scars of youth?  [Chorus]
*"Desire"*From the very first rush To the very last sigh In a moment's touch To the whole of time Be the secrets of pain Kiss the tears that you cry  Just to hold without Get to touch within From the sound of your breath To the taste of your skin I'd give all my days Just for one of your nights  I've just got to get next to you Let it out, let it go  [Chorus:] Desire, make it physical Looks to feed the thrill Desire, with its hungry eyes Closing for the kill Desire, all that's left in me Tears the night in two Desire, like a primitive Claw my way to you Are you thinking of me Like I'm thinking of you?  How the innocence dies In a passionate stare A shaft of light A silent dare The call of the wild...  From the very first crime Of original sin To the carnal lie Where the truth begins Just to feel your nails Lift me up like wings  I've just got to get next to you Let it out, let it go  [Chorus]
*"Summer"*Her fingers feel the air The mantle now so bare From green then into brown Lie scattered all around We hope they will return Like those before did learn Now that their summer's gone We have to carry on  Till we rise, I just can't wait Now tell me, who are you To judge my fate?  [Chorus:] Oh, the rain burns on Now that summer's gone Oh, the wind blows strong Now that summer's gone  Across the fields we ran To emerald castles, banned By rule of modern man Who built a winterland Then as the seasons change He'll fly and hide away Above a cloud of words On wings of gold I heard  We must rise, it's not too late Now tell me, who are you To change our fate?  [Chorus]
*"Sad Situation"*When you wake, I'll be gone Just a space, an empty chair And I know, I was wrong Just one more time, then I'll be gone  Who stopped the sky from falling? Who held you back from harm? Who stood as walls were falling? A call still guides us on  [Chorus:] It's a sad situation And no one's to blame It's a sad situation Now you're gone It's a sad situation Which someday may change It's a sad situation Now you're gone  In the dawn, turn the page We stand alone, as the lions rage I suppose we'll move on A fight of minds, that still breathe strong  Who stopped the sky from falling? Who held you back from harm? Who held you close when hurting? Who keeps the doves of hope?  [Chorus]
*"Feels Like Love"*Feel my mind, the sleep is ending As we rush into the sea Take my eyes, and I will show you The future in the deep  You must breathe on You must be strong  Am I right to fight the distance As we push against the tide?  You must breathe on You must be strong  Rushing through my head, I can touch the thunder Lighting up the mind, as the wind blows stronger Pushing back the sea, as the storm is calling on Louder than before, in the raging river Faster than the stream, will it last forever? Holding back the time, as the world stops turning  Feels like love... Tell me, does it feel like love?  We look to the sky, to the statue of hope She is holding the flame, as the island awoke To the city of dreams, where the angel still sleeps See the satellites glow as they rise from the sea  Feels like love... Tell me, does it feel like love?
*"Rememberance Day"*The battlefield, the smoke has cleared Silence in sight, the blood lies deep Look from the hills, the valley calls Six hundred fall, a lost to all  Someday, somewhere, ever calling One time, one life, ever falling  [Chorus:] And will you remember The flowers in the fields? And will you remember The loss of one so dear And will you remember Through the mist of lies? Remember Their spirit never dies Remember  Out of the skies, and into the green Fuelled by the lies, paid by soul  Soldier, hero, well 'Uncle Sam' He don't wanna know  [Chorus]
*"Enough's Enough"*So early in the morning It's the same now every day Sign your name and number Cutting from the ball and chain  Never letting go when The weight was so deceiving Treading on a turning wheel  Machinery is screaming Shoulder to the stone again Praying for the evening Hiding as the fist hits steel  [Chorus:] Enough's enough It's eye to eye Enough's enough We cry Enough's enough Of smoke and steel Enough's enough Of turning this wheel  Looking at his picture Steel did turn the skin to bone Father I remember The hands that had to break the stone  [Chorus]
*"Military Man"*The fighting's over now There's nowhere left to run My ammunition's out I'd better put down my gun And as I face this life of fear I'd better keep my conscience clear Inside my mind I'm out of it And I ain't never coming back  [Chorus:] So don't come running here to find me 'Cos I'm a military man And as I spin this wheel of fortune In my military world I'm a military man  The architects of time Are calling me But I don't believe it Necessarily And as I face this life of fear Break the chains That bind me here Inside my head I'm out of it But I'm still never coming back  [Chorus]  I'm a military man Just a military man yes I am
*"Aria"*As I look back In that last act Far beyond the call of duty  Did I stay strong? Did I give more? Far beyond the call of duty  And I know, you know... now
*"Heart Of Gold"*We are the future within our dome A new generation, we live alone Washed the words from the subway wall We had to fight to survive You still can have it all So listen to our cry  With a mind of steel, but a heart of gold The winds of change you can move the stone By the hands of love you must free the soul To live forever with a heart of gold  We are the future, we hold the key The messengers are calling, "wake up your race" All but man did turn to dust Then we saw her fall Cut her down by the sword of greed So listen to our cry  With a mind of steel, but a heart of gold The winds of change you can move the stone By the hands of love you must free the soul To live forever with a heart of gold  With a mind of steel, but a heart of gold The winds of change you can move the stone By the hands of love you must free the soul To live forever with a heart of gold  You are the future, it's up to you You are the future, it's up to you
*"Tears"*Tears in my eyes, tears in my eyes Feeling like there's nothing left to say Maybe I should wait for another day One more day  Tried to find myself, but now you're gone I had to find the strength to carry on Carry on  Tears in my eyes How they fall like rain to the floor Where do you go when the summer's gone? Walking away is the same as closing the door Can you look at the sky when the sun don't shine?  Look in my eyes You can see my dreams on the floor Where do I go now the summer is gone? Run through the field like a child who's closing the door You're feeling the wind now the sun don't shine  Losing you would always be my fear Never knowing if you'd still be here Still be here  Remembering the words you said to me Saying that you had to set me free Set me free  Ghosts of love will come Now the light is gone Haunting my soul Never letting go  Through my broken dreams Hear you calling me Lonely like the wind Echoes back again  Feeling like there's nothing left to say...
*"Fight Against The Tide"*When the doubts you have begin to show When the winds of change begin to blow your dream away As the winter cold can touch the bone And like a crowd, voices in your mind But as the thunder dies, you're standing on your own Even in your darkest night When the shadows hide the guiding light that leads the way alone And heaven seems to turn it's head Sometimes, to break away the ties You have to find the strength to carry on  Fight against the tide To cut the hardest stone Fight against the tide The blood begins to flow Hold on, through the storm could take your life Be strong and you will survive  You won't give in Even though the walls around you fall No don't give in Still the flames alive 'Till the end of time And so you fight against the tide When the doubts you have begin to show When the winds of change begin to blow your dream away When the fire has left your soul Look straight ahead In the face of fear Take on the world and all it has to give  Fight against the tide To cut the hardest stone Fight against the tide The blood begins to flow Hold on, through the storm could take your life Be strong and you will survive
*"We Fall Apart"*Was a dark day through old eyes again As the flames rise to lick blue wounds again See the chrome claw kiss the black sky into again Hear the pin fall like a steel fist on stone again  When we were young, we were strong We'd belong, close at heart So in time, as the powers dies We must belong, till we fall We fall apart  In the neon dawn we will rise again From the thin shell deep inside the wall  When we were young, we were strong We'd belong, close at heart So in time, as the powers dies We must belong, till we fall We fall apart  When we were young, we were strong We'd belong, close at heart So in time, as the powers dies We must belong, till we fall We fall apart
*"Boys From Diamond City"*Echoes of a million years, lie twisted in my face In a world without no name, and a stranger human race In the distance how it shines, sparkles in the light Like a flower pulls you in, you lose your mind.  And it really doesn't matter if the sky should fall Your living under ground, there's no sky at all Nothing much changes  We're the boys of the diamond city We're tough like diamond We're the boys of the diamond city So rough, like diamonds  I remember nightmare days, like packs of dogs we'd roam Through the broken city streets, through the broken city's bone It's so hard to stand your ground, it's so hard to stay alive 'Cos when you fight for what you keep, you know you fight for your life  And it really doesn't matter if the sky should fall Your living under ground, there's no sky at all Nothing much changes  We're the boys of the diamond city We're tough like diamond We're the boys of the diamond city So rough, like diamonds  I remember a time A giant skyline And a blue, blue sky It's almost dreamlike We're the boys of the diamond city  We're the boys of the diamond city We're tough like diamond We're the boys of the diamond city So rough, like diamonds
*"A.L.O."*Brown suede shoes and corduroys Greasy hair not out of choice Trying hard to blend in with the boys Standing in the corner of the room He would see her every Friday night Watching all the guys hold her so tight Looks in her eyes But she doesn't even know his name  He would give her just anything To hear her voice To hear her sing "I love you"  Climbing mountains so high He won't give in Risk the thin thread of life To find his dream There is no turning back In the face of attack Looking for the key of her heart  She's the reason of his dreams Heroine to his pirate king Marylin to his Jimmy Dean Swept away to the sound of violins Friday night and it's all for real She don't know just how he feels Maybe this could be her lucky day  He would give her just anything To hear her voice To hear her sing "I love you"  Climbing mountains so high He won't give in Risk the thin thread of life To find his dream There is no turning back In the face of attack Looking for the key of her heart

*"Dusty Road"*I walk the line, look straight ahead A second chance, one slip and it's gone Though the bird has flown, the sands of time stand still Scars that never heal, wounds you always feel  Keep on walking that dusty road, blinded by the flame Keep on walking that dusty road, never giving in  A single light, you hold your breath Your heart beats fast, a skin that burns Maybe the tide has turned, one goal you know is near And wish of a thousand nights, voices you always hear  So keep on walking that dusty road, blinded by the flame Keep on walking that dusty road, never giving in
*"I Believe"*Through the fields that have changed with time The spirit still grows stronger I can see the boy inside I can feel the hunger  But there's a shadow that is thrown upon us Like a thief come in the night They still try and put us down We stand and fight  I believe We're gonna rise and steal the thunder I believe We're gonna hold this flame forever I believe  Like an arrow from a burning bow It's aim once born of anger Like a river that forever flows The years our only danger  The water washes over me But I still can breathe the fire Oh Lord, I'm just a man No longer giving it all away  I believe We're gonna rise and steal the thunder I believe We're gonna hold this flame forever I believe
*"Obsession"*Can I feel your hair soft on wet skin Deep inside I bleed from the blade within Can I reach the burning, burning moon Can I change this madness, lust consume Breathing out and breathing in - begin  Suddenly I wake from a calling sweat Blood red water on my head Was I only dreaming the flesh so real What would another good sin reveal  Breathing out and breathing in I can't fight the drug within Feel the first hit to the heart  You're my shot, your my obsession Hear the voices say I can't turn and walk away - yeah You're my shot, your my obsession Hear the voices  Oh - how I need to hold onto fire to win Pumping through my veins love's adrenalin Can you hear those voices  Breathing out and breathing in I can't fight the drug within Feel the first hit to the heart  You're my shot, your my obsession Hear the voices say I can't turn and walk away - yeah You're my shot, your my obsession Hear the voices say
*"Moon Under The Water"*In the movement of the waves Feel the rushing of the wind You're in everything I see  Like a visionaries dream Preaching to the silence It's waiting for me  Like a moon under the water There's a sky under the sea This world is like an ocean An it's drowning me There's a moon under the water  Throw a stone into the pool See the ripples run forever And, time, for longer still  See the moon under the water And the sky under the sea This world is like an ocean An it's drowning me  There's a moon under the water There's a sky under the sea
*"Love Like The Video"*She sends her smile by satellite Steaming up the screen at night Got the mouth, knows how to squeeze Every line of make-believe In the flesh, just like a dream Fingers touch the fantasy To hold so close, her lips near mine Bodies on the borderline  Oh, when the lights went down I held my breath But she held the freeze frame  Love like the video Why can't she love like the video  Captured hot on thirty-five Tempting all to idolise Leading lady, pleading man Picture post, L.A., Cannes Every take is just like the first Every fake so well rehearsed Passions are the cruelest part Deception in the coolest heart  Oh, when the lights went down I held my breath But she held the freeze frame  Love like the video Why can't she love like the video
*"Don't Come To Me"*Walking down the avenue Every step I take I see you There's nothing more that I can do To hold back from crying  It's not that I don't have the time To hear your voice would only cost a dime I'm gonna save myself a dime And you know why  'Cos in the night, when you're alone And there is no one you can turn to As you're reaching for the phone  Don't come to me I won't be there you see You turned this heart to stone Now you'll walk alone So don't come to me  How did I get left this way? I must have been born yesterday Every single word you'd say Were lies, lies, lies  Still walking down that avenue Every step I take I see you There's nothing more that I can do To hold back from crying  Don't come to me 'Cos I won't be there you see You turned this heart to stone Now you'll walk alone So don't come to me
*"Satellite Blues"*Hey you, you're walking down a New York street Feel the tension in the midday heat You're walking on blood TV, it's all there on a Japanese screen East, West, there's no in between Now, we just love "The Reds"  Everything is now because the past is dead You've got to look forward if you want to get ahead What kind of person sells a young person drugs? You bring them up good but don't call them thugs Third world stories, well they make the news It's a five minute wonder, call it...  Satellite blues Any way the wind blows  Dive, dive! Underground is just the place to be So cool, it keeps the city clean Now walk on by  I said "Walk, walk, don't run!" Don't you know you've got to follow the signs? This life's so cruel, so cruel to be kind It's a one-way street  You've got to live on the edge just to make a big deal This life's big fun, man, it's like a roulette wheel What kind of world would let these children die? There's so much money we could all retire We could all live happily if we choose But it's a five minute wonder, call it...  Satellite blues Any way the wind blows
*"Showdown"*She cried to the southern wind About a love that was sure to end Every dream in her heart was gone Headin' for a showdown  Bad dreamer, what's your name Looks like we're ridin' on the same train Looks as though there'll be more pain There's gonna be a showdown  And it's rainin all over the world It's raining all over the world Tonight, the longest night  She came to me like a friend She blew in on a southern wind Now my heart is turned to stone again There's gonna be a showdown  Save me, oh save me It's unreal, the suffering There's gonna be a showdown  And it's rainin all over the world It's raining all over the world Tonight the longest night
*"That Season"*I told her, I'd hold her All through that first cold winter Defend her, protect her From our darkest demons  Then spring came, our world changed We found a different corner Still heading, still searching For what we had that season  I thought I was so strong, a man on a blue mountain The sword in my hand, but my thoughts in the clouds then See them Hear them  I would never change another day If that season was the one to stay I swear I'd never change another day  Ten years now, I've waited For that coldest winter No whiter, no wiser And all we hear is thunder  I thought I was so strong, a father on a mountain The sword in my hand, but my thoughts in the clouds then See them Hear them  I would never change another day If that season was the one to stay I swear I'd never change another day [Repeat]  Ten years now, I've waited For that coldest winter No wiser, no whiter Oh how I miss that season
*"Can't Tell These Walls"*You said time would heal all the scars inside, But hurt seems to grow not die No matter how I try I regret the things that I've said Can't forget the words you misread that night I know I was unkind Sitting here all alone How I wish I could change the past Feelings hidden, unshown Behind the mask  Can't stop the rain from falling Can't stop the world from turning Can't take the cold, the hurting Can't tell these walls I'm missing you  Fallen down, can I pick myself up from the ground? Look at the face of this clown I've tried to hide the tears Sitting here all alone How I wish I could change the past Is there ever a chance? Still the river flows  Can't stop the rain from falling Can't stop the world from turning Can't take the cold, the hurting Can't tell these walls I'm missing you
*"The Higher You Climb"*There is no comeback from the big divide Maybe there's a future to be found waiting on the other side If it's illusion, then what is real? In life's confusion, take what you can Fight it till you reach the goal.  And the higher you climb you can fall But never look down And the faster you run, it's a crawl To the end of the line.  Seems all directions lead to one place There are no signposts guiding me It takes a long time to see  And the higher you climb you can fall But never look down And the faster you run, it's a crawl To the end of the line.  The age of reason has come and gone The changing seasons move on and on until you reach the goal  And the higher you climb you can fall But never look down And the faster you run, it's a crawl To the end of the line.
*"Right To Cry"*He kept it all inside - alive and screaming Tears were not his style, his pride was leading  I watched the light dancing on the sea As it turned to grey Oh, how I wish that the tide would soon return Someday, someday  I've a right to cry That's not giving in Scars from you and I, scars we kept within There's a right to cry, it's not giving up With my right to cry, now I've had enough  It's hard to break the bones of life, of living A side you'll never show, let go, don't need it  Hold on, hold on, hold on I can see in your eyes and I know how you're going to feel  I watched the light dancing on the sea As it turned to grey Oh, how I wish that the tide would soon return Someday, someday  I've a right to cry That's not giving in Scars from you and I, scars we kept within There's a right to cry, it's not giving up With my right to cry, now I've had enough
*"Arena"*You can take it If you want it You can break it If you need it  I'll never fight another day But you can take the flesh not the soul away They're calling from the lions den They're fighting for the ghosts of holy men  Into the arena we climb We look to the sky Into the arena we climb You and I  Is it over When the light goes? Bella nova Tell me who knows  Scars will beat the minds of men Can you feel the thorns upon the skin? I'll never fight another day till I die  [Chorus:] Yes I hear you Yes I see you Yes I feel you And I need you  Is it over, I'll never fight another day When the light goes? But you can take the flesh, not the soul away Bella nova, they're calling from the lions den Tell me who knows? They're fighting for the souls of holy men  [Chorus]
*"Heaven"*In the distance, I can see them On the trade winds, across stormy seas. They are many, please believe me, There's something to find, There's someplace here deep inside of my mind.  There is a time where, There is no place here. Tell me if you get there... Heaven  Can you see this land I'm dreaming? Such a place, I hope we will find. Is it there now? Tell me where now, 'Cos I need to know. Believe... It's still deep inside of my mind.  There is a time where, There is no place here. Tell me if you get there... Heaven
*"2 Sides Of The Moon"*Laser, breathing on my window Two strings, beating out of time Koto, warning of the danger Wake up, is your head still mine?  Now they give you reasons To fight for love  That's enough In a paper world That's enough Said the Chinese girl That's enough Another city falls Just because we're two sides of the moon  Data, streaming through my window Chrome stars, whispering their lies Black sky, hides approaching stranger Reach out, two should now be one  Disregard the reasons And look above  That's enough In a paper world That's enough Said the Siamese girl That's enough Another city falls Just because we're two sides of the moon
*"Day Before The War"*Standing on the border, Waiting on the line. Silence is a stranger, In these troubled times. I recall a better place, Where I controlled my mind. We had no fears at all... The day before the war.  Hands across the water, The sun is in the East. Who will feed the famine After lions feast? In the name of Jesus, In the name of God, You took it all in vain... The day before the war.  Standing on the border, Waiting on the line. Feet in bloody water, Deafened by the crime. I recall the beauty, Young will never see. We had no fears at all... The day before the war.  Hearts across the water, The sun is in the East. Ships arrived this morning, From the burning sea. Take away the glory, Take away the pain. You were a friend of mine... The day before the war.
*"Never"*It seems such a long year Since our eyes last met. You were a lone child, I have no regrets.  Oh, you know sometimes how I wonder, If I am a fool. The rocks that are pulling me under Are heading a fall.  Don't be afraid You're not alone, now By the guard of angels A new rock will rise As mountains cut sky, now Heaven knows  Never, Never, I could never lose my faith in you (could I ever break my faith to you) Never, Never, Will I ever turn my back on you  You must be strong now And stand as a man. As I will be leaving, Leaving this land.  Sometimes I wonder, If I am a fool. The rocks that are pulling me under Are heading a fall.  Turn my back on you
*"Falling"*Another meltdown, Another change of state. Some other big town, Where he can make his break.  And she said, "No, I like it this way." And he said, "Oh, does this mean I can stay?"  I feel like I'm just caving in I really do And what is to be must be  Help me, now I'm falling Give me early warning Help me, I'm in danger, over you  So how you feeling? You know it's not too late. Don't hold your head down, You must recuperate.  And she said, "No, I like it this way." And he said, "Oh, does this mean I can stay?"  I feel like I'm just caving in I really do And what is to be must be  Help me, now I'm falling Give me early warning Help me, I'm in danger, over you
*"Words"*If I whispered words, would you hear them now? Would you cross the deepest seas? In the fiercest winds, on the burning trail, Seal it with your word.  If I whispered words, would you keep a lie? Would you promise me till time? So if we grow old and the distance parts, So seal it with your word.  Oh, I'll scream upon the hill, So, you can hear me still. Now, will we ever fade? I seal it with my word.  If I whispered words, would you hear them now? Would you cross the deepest seas? In the fiercest winds, on the burning trail, Seal it with your word.
*"U Bring Me Down"*Don't tell me what you are Don't tell me what you're after Don't tell me what you want Don't tell me what you need Aren't you just the one to always point the finger I don't care for you 'cos you don't care for me!  U bring me down........[repeat]  [Counter Rap:] U bring me down You're giving me no hope Sucking off our land Blowing off the smoke Virus in the veins That run into the sea Poisoning the world With you're generosity  U bring me down You're killing me with lies You take away our ears Won't take away my eyes The red red sea will return unto the vein Covering the world Are you happy with your gain  [Refrain]  I could breathe, I could fly The day before you came (Think you own my skin now) Break the chains, free the slave Turn the tides against you now  Talking to the sky You promise evolution Progression of the mind By selling of the soul The last will be the first In the dust of revolution  Someone cares for me But no one cares for you  [Refrain 2]  Will I breathe? Will I see? Far beneath the clearest stream (To the deepest ocean) Break the chains, free the slaves Give back the blood, that you drain from this world now
*"Tell Me Why"*Tell me why, I don't believe in you. I don't believe it's true. I don't believe in you.  Happens nearly every time, If you let them, they'll control your mind, Yes your mind.  But that was only yesterday, So you had to wash your head in hate. In hate, in hate.  Tell me why, I don't believe in you. I don't believe it's true. I don't believe in you.  Shall we stand against the wind? Staring at the justice of their sins, Their sins.  What have they done to live this way? In a modern world, the fragile pay They pay, oh yes they pay.  Tell me why, I don't believe in you. I don't believe it's true. I don't believe in you.
*"Turn It Around"*Took the ground, From underneath my feet. Silent town, Ghosts this empty street.  I see the home that once was mine, Now just bones of former life. Touch this page of sacred time, again, I see you call...  You don't have to be strong for me. I won't shoot your defences down. Whatever happens, I want you to see We can face it together. And turn it around.  A new life Grows within his hands. Coming back To this promised land.  And with these bones we will rebuild, To the flesh of future life. Giving back that sacred time, again...  You don't have to be strong for me. I won't shoot your defences down. Whatever happens, I want you to see, We can face it together. And turn it around.

*"Awake"*"The dawning of a brand new day The waking of the whispers say: That sleeping heavens will return In deepest night the secret learned And from these walls this city lies The past will be our future The journey will be over, Awake!"  I saw the writing on the wall The story of our birth then fall Within their tombs of holy stone The scrolls of life, one man alone So if we try, we can live and learn The sands will pull you under Don't let them pull you under Awake!  I travelled to a foreign land Through stormy seas and burning sand Led by the stars the ancient stream The call of treasures yet unseen So if we climb to the rocks of kings Together we'll discover The source of all our wonder Awake!  Someday we're going to go back to the stars And find the answer, who we really are A traveller through the lonely mists of time Creation from the sky  The dawning of a brand new day The waking of the whispers say: That sleeping heavens will return In deepest night the secret learned From these walls this city lies The past will be our future The journey will be over Awake!  Someday we're going to go back to the stars And find the answer who we really are A traveller through the lonely mists of time Creation from the sky  Someday we're going to back to the stars And find the answer who we really are If we try, we can live and learn Together we'll discover The source of all our wonder Awake!  We saw the writing We read the story Awake!
*"Wherever You Are"*Whenever your shadow falls on stony ground And there's not a hand for you to hold Whenever the dreams you dream come crashing down  Every time you think of home Remember that you're not alone And we'll be with you heart and soul Wherever you are  And if you should lose your path along the way And find yourself walking in the dark Whenever the ones you love seem far away  Every time you think of home Remember that you're not alone And we'll be with you heart and soul Wherever you are  Whenever the fears you hide come reaching through Every time you think of home Remember that you're not alone And we'll be with you heart and soul  Every time you think of home Remember that you're not alone And we'll be with you heart and soul We'll be with you heart and soul Wherever you are  We're with you heart and soul
*"Ready To Go Home"*On the street below these walls Where I used to walk Now I can barely crawl All this darkness rising tall Lord, shine a light for me I'm waiting to be calle  I'm ready to go home I'm ready to receive Forgiveness for my sins I'm ready to begin  Take this river to the sea Where the delta flows The tide is washing over me Guide this soul to Heaven's door Show me where tomorrow lies I'm waiting to be home  I'm ready to lay down I'm ready now to sleep A promise I must keep I'm ready to go home  Sometimes I lay down with these memories Breathe shallow, deep inside of me Time has run its course with me And I'm ready to go home  When the evening shadows fall When the time has come I let defences fall To surrender's to survive I will give up everything To those I leave behind  I'm ready to go home I'm ready to receive Forgiveness for my sins I'm ready to begin  I'm ready to lay down I'm ready now to sleep A promise I must keep I'm ready to go home Again
*"The Last Time"*If you want it Don't look at my face It's the last time  It's not forever The dust in the wind It's the last time  One world, one dream The stars in your hand No light, no life The scars are made by man Heaven can't help you now  In this madness Take it while you can It's the last time  This Holy water Running away For the last time  One world, one dream The stars in your hand No light, no life So heal the scars of man One chance, this night To shine on this land This time, with pride Give back now while you can  All these fields, that once were green Have turned to smoke and steel The sun will fall, and the last moon rise Don't turn this tide away  If you want it So start it again It's the last time (The scars were made by man)  It's not forever The dust is the wind For the last time  One world, one dream The stars in your hand No light, no life So heal the scars of man One chance, this night To shine on this land This time, with pride Give back now while you can
*"Forgive Me"*Silent wave coming down on me Washing out the lie Living inside me  Life's not hard Now I'm on TV This sudden twist of Fate  I am direct salvation Just send in your donation I can promise that you'll be save  Forgive me, World I'm just a man who's lost his way Forgive me, these two words I pray It's time to make a change  Yesterday was a different day Thought I knew the answer A vision in my mind  Search my soul And then you will find A shelter for my pain  The truth is in the open And now my heart has spoken Hoping maybe you'll hear my cry  Forgive me, World I'm just a man who's lost his way Forgive me, these two words I pray It's time to make a change  Forgive me, World I'm just a man who sins today Forgive me, these two words I pray My Faith is still the same  Maybe I can't change the past Maybe love can bring us back Maybe we can try and start again.

*"On The Coldest Day In Hell"*Do you remember years ago? All our hopes would ebb and flow We thought we'd find a Promised Land Our footprints in the sand  The mysteries, the twists of Fate Have changed the path from love to hate But won't erase sins of the past They hide behind the mask  If I could conquer all our fears Can forgiveness dry the tears? If I falter, my soul I'll sell On the coldest day in Hell  I'll never let you down How can I tell you now? But only Heaven knows I won't let you go  I dream of demons through the night A restless fever till morning light My body's cold, my head's on fire Give me back my life  Kill this ghost inside of me Let me sail on deep blue seas A new beginning, another page Dawn gives in to day  I will conquer all our fears Let forgiveness dry the tears If I falter my soul I'll sell On the coldest day in Hell  I'll never let you down How can I tell you now? But only Heaven knows I won't let you go I swear I'll stand my ground How can I turn this round? As this time Heaven knows I won't let you know  When I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming of you When I'm breathing, I'm breathing with you  But only Heaven knows I won't let you go
*"Free"*Look into the distance, you're living in a cage A fire burns inside you, that fuels all the rage You're thinking of the outside, and dream of the past The gates to freedom lie within your grasp They're changing the system, rewriting the laws Renaming religion, reshaping your cause You always be lonely, walking with fools The shadows in the doorways make the rules  Because you're free, this time Don't be scared of who you are Free, to find There's no hiding in the dark  A new day is dawning, a New Age begun Nobody told you which way you should run Wait for the thunder, break from the shell Is this the gate to freedom from this Hell?  Because you're free, this time Don't be scared of who you are Free, to find There's no hiding in the dark Free, this time You can learn to live again Free, to find There is shelter from the rain Free  They're razing the fences in the pastures of doom The fields of our heroes, the land won by few The call of a New World, dream to transcend Now it's time to fight and start again  Because you're free, this time Don't be scared of who you are Free, to find There's no hiding in the dark Because you're free, this time You can learn to live again Free, to find There is shelter from the rain
*"You're The Stranger"*Don't hang that sign on me You're the stranger Don't try to talk to me You're the stranger  On the seas They came from far away From the skies Their silver birds of prey  In one day Ten thousand years could change We are fools To live your pilgrim ways  Don't hang that sign on me You're the stranger Don't try to talk to me You're the stranger  And we drive Five hundred miles this time To the edge Of crystal-cut blue sky  Silence breathes South of the border line Silent trees Look back and wonder why  Did Father and his Holy Son Spread the word and point the gun? And where the eagle used to fly They carve their concrete in the sky Tearing at our Mother's skin Taking all her blood within Remember how it used to be?  Did Father and his Holy Son Spread the word and point the gun And where the eagle used to fly They carve their concrete in the sky Tearing at our Mother's skin Taking all her blood within Remember how it used to be?

*"The Longest Night"*"What passing-bells for these who die as cattle? - Only the monstrous anger of the guns. Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle Can patter out their hasty orisons. No mockeries now for them; no prayers nor bells; Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs, - The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells; And bugles calling for them from sad shires."  [Wilfred Owen, 1918]  Now the day has run When the cover comes But any fool can see Ahead  Silence is my friend But it has to end Any fool can see Ahead  It's the longest night It's the longest night Cold winds may blow On the longest night  So we write our letters To those far away Any fool can see Ahead  The distant sound of thunder A choir of wailing shells Any fool can see Ahead  It's the longest night It's the longest night Cold winds may blow On the longest night I don't want to fight I don't know who's right Cold winds they blow On this longest night  It's the longest night It's the longest night Cold winds may blow On this longest night

Your mind control, your gift of lies You brother, dear we're screaming You said you cared, we needed you You mother, now you're leaving  So... we live... Under The Gun... We live... Under The Gun...

*"There Was A Time"*There was a perfect time for us, it seems so long ago We were so nave about the things we both should know The best intentions come to nil when love has lost desire And slowly years will show the dying embers of a fire  There was a time when I loved you And a time when I lied I put none up above you And I tried, yes I tried I'd stand aside, so you could be free But all of the time I was running from me, I'd lay down my life, if you'd asked that of me, Yeah, there was a time  To look at all the years gone by, I made mistakes it's true It's always just the little things remind me of you All too often, I will sit, and wonder where I've been For every time I look at you, I'll know you're thinking of him  There was a time I respected you, There were times when I cried When I was expected to, I would stand at your side And you ask me would I do it again, I would tell you the truth, look you straight in your eyes And I'd say it though most would think me insane I'd say it although I have nothing to gain Yeah, There was a time There will come a time for you  There was a time when I loved you And a time when I lied There were none up above you And for you, I'd have died But the big wheel turns at last When all my emotions were tied up with you My hopes and my dreams could never win through The path has been cleared, now I'm free of you Yeah, now is my time  There will come a time for you
*"I Believe"*Through the fields that have changed with time The spirit still grows stronger I can see the boy inside I can feel the hunger  But there's a shadow that is thrown upon us Like a thief come in the night They still try and put us down We stand and fight  I believe We're gonna rise and steal the thunder I believe We're gonna hold this flame forever I believe  Like an arrow from a burning bow It's aim once born of anger Like a river that forever flows The years our only danger  The water washes over me But I still can breathe the fire Oh Lord, I'm just a man No longer giving it all away  I believe We're gonna rise and steal the thunder I believe We're gonna hold this flame forever I believe
*"Don't Wanna Lose You Now"*Hey, what a spectacular evening Yeah, why would I ever complain? If it wasn't for you, I don't know what I would do So you help me through And I don't wanna lose you Hey, what would you say if I told you I thank you for all that I am Cos I was on my own I just can't do it alone 'Cos I don't know how And I don't wanna lose you now  So you help me through And I don't wanna lose you  And if there's something that I can do for you Just call my name and I will be coming through Any time, or place at all I will be there... yeah!  Sometimes it's too hard to be honest These things don't come easy to me So while we've been apart I've just followed my heart And it's in your hands, so I don't wanna lose you now
*"Tomorrow The World"*Tomorrow the world will seem a little clearer, The planets align and all will be revealed, Don't question it all, your dream is getting nearer, But you can tell the world just how you feel, oh.  The spinning roulette wheel, The laugh of the gods, The odds are so good now, But the goods are all very odd.  The eye of a black cat, One turn of a card, One foot of a rabbit, And your world is falling apart.  Tomorrow the world will be more simpatico. Tomorrow the world won't make you feel so small. Whenever the world is threatening to be so. Just wrap it up, and throw it like a ball.  Four leaves of a shamrock, May be your best shot, Your ship is in dry dock, And you'll never be what you're not.  Just think what you can do, You can turn it around, You do what you have to, And you will be standing your ground.  Don't walk away, don't you give in, Don't walk away, and please don't cry, Or say goodbye...  A dollar will get you ten that you'll be happy, But maybe that's really all that you can see, The planet will not have changed but one iota, For as I give, the world will give to me...  Don't walk away, don't you give in, Don't walk away, and please don't cry, Or say goodbye...  Tomorrow the world will seem a little clearer, The planets align and all will be revealed, Don't question it all, your dream is getting nearer, And you can tell the world just how you feel, oh  Tomorrow the world...
*"Bury Me In Willow"*I'll go whichever way the winds blow, It's hard to swim against the tide, The willow bends in a tornado, The oak will shatter as it dies.  Save me, and give me the peace to surrender at last. When I'm gone do this thing for me, For this is my final day, you know I would not joke, So bury me in willow, not in oak.  Give me no standard, no eulogy, No red, white and blue, no sceptre and no cloak, Just bury me in willow, not in oak.  A life of conflict was unending, Collision, damage, disarray. So blind, intolerant, unbending, Just let me die a different way.  Free me, and give me the peace to surrender at last.  When I'm gone, do this thing for me, For this is my final day, and you know I would not joke, So bury me in willow, not in oak.  Give me no standard, no eulogy, No red, white and blue, no sceptre and no cloak, Just bury me in willow, not in oak.  [Bridge]  When I'm gone do this thing for me, For this is my final day, you know I would not joke, So bury me in willow, not in oak.  Give me no standard, no eulogy, No red, white and blue, no sceptre and no cloak, Just bury me in willow, not in oak.  Free me, 'n' give me the beautiful silence at last.
*"No Religion"*I'll see you in the castle, Corner of Wigmore Street. We'll take a drink, and maybe think, Seek a sordid place where we can meet. More forgotten people, rain still teeming down. That's all there is to do, In this desperate and dismal town. But I still I keep on comin', I daisy-chain my life away. Gotta keep on doing nothing, Till the call on Judgement Day.  Got no religion, just living hell. If I had money, I'd drop it all in the wishing well. Stand in the doorway, wait for a man to come. Got no religion, and my life's just begun.  Waiting for next Sarurday night, When it all kicks off. I got a date with miss Ludo, Ludovica Nabokov. Nothing happened last weekend, I guess it never will. It stays the same if I don't change, There is no panacea pill. But I still I keep on comin', I daisy-chain my life away. I try to keep on doing nothing, Till the call on Judgement Day.  Got no religion, just living hell. If I had some money, I'd drop it all in the wishing well. Stand in the doorway, wait for a man to come. Got no religion, and my life's just begun.  Got no religion.  I try to change most everything, I even change my name. I change my clothes, and I change my friends. But I end up still the same. "Change must come from within" That's what the man has said... "Willingness is all you need, son - you're old, but you're not dead"  And still it keeps on comin', I daisy-chain my life away. I try to keep on doing nothing, Till the call for Judgement Day.  Got no religion, nowhere to run Got nothing going, and I still can't feel the sun. Wait for a new day, a Messianic dawn, Same terraced houses, with their cold curtains drawn.  Got no religion, just living hell. If I had some money, I'd drop it all in the wishing well. Stand in the doorway, wait for the man to come. Got no religion, and my life's just begun.  Yeah my life's just begun!
*"Faithful"*So many faces in my life at times, Couldn't change the way I feel. I will talk what you forget, To live in love with no regret.

*"Face On The Bridge"*It was a day, just like any other day I walked alone, through the old town But what happened then, would have happened anyway The water stopped turning, and time stood still  What could it be, that set you apart from the people I meet Thousands of faces, there's only one I can see A face in the crowd, that's calling so loud that it hurts me Here in this place, you are the face on the bridge  Unlock my head, to the king of Bohemia I give my thanks, for she set me free Without this girl, I would simply not be here Her face on the bridge, made a man of me  What could it be, that set you apart from the people I meet Thousands of faces, there's only one I can see A face in the crowd, that's calling so loud that it hurts me Here in this place you are the face on the bridge  You offered your hand, you brought me back from the edge Here in this place, you are the face on the bridge  What could it be, that set you apart from the people I meet Thousands of faces, there's only one I can see A face in the crowd, that's calling so loud that it hurts me Here in this place, you are the face on the bridge  You offered your hand, you brought me back from the edge Here in this place, you are the face on the bridge  You are the face on the bridge You are the face on the bridge You are the face on the bridge

Our existence is just floating at sea Cut adrift from the people we are  There is no answer, no question, no lie I'm losing count of days passing by It's like cancer, it's consuming my soul Nothing there, nothing left, should I die  You can't see, what you do to me, if you did Then you might even try I cannot breathe, no way to proceed And I ain't got what I need to get by  The closer I get to you The further you push me away I don't know what to do I just don't know what to say  The closer I get to you The further you push me away I don't know what to do I just don't know what to say  I walk the street 'cos I don't wanna go home I know that something's so wrong I guess I just can't face the truth of it all And admit it's been dead for so long  If I could then I would sit with you now To talk, and try to make sense And summon every ounce of courage I have But I can't, for the fear is immense  Don't even need to know a reason for this Just leave it all in the past Or I will tumble down into the abyss And this breath that I take is my last  You can't see, what you do to me, if you did Then you might even try I cannot breathe, no way to proceed And I ain't got what I need to get by  The closer I get to you The further you push me away I don't know what to do I just don't know what to say  The closer I get to you The further you push me away I don't know what to do I just don't know what to say  The closer I get to you The further you push me away I don't know what to do I just don't know what to say
*"Nyctophobia"*Don't blow the candle out, just leave it by my bed With all these ghosts and visions, trolls inside my head Just when the wolf will howl, the dogs begin to bark This is for real, I have a fear of the dark And as the endless nights will overturn the days Intellectual logic seems to vanish in a haze  Paranoia has the measure of me Hallucinations now dictate reality I'm hearing voices now, I wish that I could see I look around, I know there's no-one here but me The mirror shimmers there's an angel here at last Always demons looking back, and laughing through the glass  Nyctophobia, fear of the dark  I am confused, I really don't know what to think Maybe Mr. Allen does 'cause he's a Harley shrink He asks me how I feel, I mumble "just okay" He says "ok's not a feeling, Jack, we need to peel away The layers of your onion, your emotional disease Blow all these candles out, I want you on your knees"  It's way too dark in here, it's silent as the grave It's cold and clammy, like I'm sealed into a cave There is no air in here, I'm drowning in my fear And if I close my eyes, the ground will disappear I have a chronic phobia, and up until this day There is no guarantee that it will go away  Nyctophobia, fear of the dark

Oh I can't be sure In the gathering crowd Our connection, always so secure Signal's not so loud  So I come to you What else can I do? You're the best thing I ever had You're something I need so bad Ten seconds from Leningrad  To see your face again Is all I need You give the life to me And air to breath  And when you're there, well then I'm not so cold When we're alone again As close as Russian dolls
*"Heaven Help Me Now"*Wing of angels Waves of emotion Bring her home to me  Stare down the cold blue muzzle of a steel blue gun I guess this is the final stand, nowhere to run Do I regret the past? Now I'm tied to the mast Was I brave, did I live, have I won?  Do I regret a single thing that I had to say? Self-centered pride and hubris tell me I'm okay My check's post-dated now I'm over-rated, overdrawn, and I'm still complicated  Oh, oh! Heaven help me now I'm up against the wall again I know Oh, oh! Please, please show me how I'm in too deep, so Heaven help me now  The darkest night is on me, chills me to the bone This is, by far, the hardest thing I've ever done Bring things back down to size, keep eyes upon the prize And pray, take a breath, and I say  Oh, oh!

Your evil seed's planted and grown tall You'll fall and I'll be the last one standing  There's a war going on and you're the loser There's and end of this, and it's now It is now You're going down  Shivering, shaking, breaking down in tears And all that you see is my smile Now that you're gone and I dance on your grave Maybe my soul will rest for a while

I'm ordered to the first line I'll die now - good bye now They'll say I'm lost in action I'm gone now - farewell now  Collective disorder - far by madness' border Chaos of human hatred - kneel for the open gate  Die in a war of empty lies By the hands of your reflection Lost your mind in hellish cries Shot but killed from suffocation Your bunker is your grave You were gone before it ended The price to be the brave Turned into war's descendant  The horn call and we fall Into a hell hand made for us Bloodletting - forgetting Your heart in a killing with no cause
*"The Willy"*Look at me, into the eyes of a stranger If they see us heads will roll Look at you, your life's a failure And the dolls have taken control  I'm alive and your ending shines I've never felt before that life's this grand 'Though blood is drawn I chase the dawn The view is pretty from where I stand On the battlefield, you'll be my shield I'd like to love you but you turn to sand I choose to be your enemy I'm just pretty if you understand  Slaughter me; I'm in need of killings And tender love is all we need Slaughter me, so I can lose the feelings That caresses me until I bleed  They masturbate, just want to mate Seeing your face, they seal your fate They've tried to love, I'll rise above  You fall to the ground deep below You're my rock star fantasy You're everything I want to be You are my star My way of saying: "I hate myself"  Pray for me, He won't hear me He's to busy being a god Pray to me, no salvation is easy When you're caught up loving a fraud
*"My Shining Star"*Bastard You little creep Time after time You prove that you're blind Listen Don't try to think Shut the fuck up I want you to stop  Open your mind for my heart to enter Embrace the wind Don't fear the light Open the gate - The battle can start Embrace my sin Or get out of my sight  You will kneel before it My shining star Won't it mean shit?  Force fed With your commands You nag and you nag You'll kneel and you'll beg Please don't Just listen to me Hear what I say This is the way  Open your mind for my heart to enter Embrace the wind Don't fear the light Open the gate - The battle can start Embrace my sin Or get out of my sight  No more I'll bite the hand Enough is enough This got to stop It's over I am my own No longer your slave Free to walk away
*"My Lie"*I'm not the only one, who has looked to the stars, in peace, in fear, in wonder, inside I'm everything you're not I'm everything you want I'm everything you've been I'm everything you've seen I'm not the only one, but I'm also a part, of you, of us, of nothing, of time  Time bound to your thoughts  Travelling through nothing Living in my lie A door has opened to the ocean's heart We're all within Drops of water tied to streams No one can win  Why do you tend to fear all the things that I love? The dark, the void, the depths, the end It's coming anyway It's coming our way It's coming to your door It's you it's coming for Why do you tend to fear to show what you hide, from me, from us, from nothing, from time  Time  There's nothing here to see There's nothing here for me There's nothing here to win There's only what's within You are the only one just like everyone else One wave, one thought, one world, one loss  Time is nothing but an empty void Time bound to your thoughts
*"Stranger"*Fly out of your cage Leave eighteen years of pain behind And feel the wind under your wings Victim of life, you're free now Breathe the clean air - sweet smell of death Sundown is here - Another one rises  Pain, sweet pain You're too much for me Pain, sweet pain You'll set me free  Nothing is to stay You wander on You couldn't wait Please wait for me  I ask the stars: Where have you gone? What's in the next world? Will we ever meet again?  Like a bird flying to the moon You never reached it - Your hunger was your doom Doomed to live or forced to die In this cage you were entrapped What did you see when your dreams held you wake? What did you say to the ghosts in your head?  You drowned in your own blood and tears Once you have jumped there is no way back  All these illusions, trying to make it right But it feels wrong, wrong to say goodbye My beloved stranger - Nobody knew what happened I hope you can tell me later I don't mourn your death - I just don't know why You were always close but still so far away
*"The Skinner"*You look so different When you're dead and gone And when you're dead and gone I'm alone  (I) To hold you To feel you (Feel) Be with you Inside of you (Your) Never felt this alive (pain) (We) I hold you I am you (Are) We are one (The) My blood runs through (same) Your Veins The skinner  To smell you was not enough Just to hear and watch Just to kiss and touch Not enough  Skin you to be inside of you Try to find the beauty within My feelings are sincere and true Just for you  Never smile, never cry Never again Never smile, never cry Never again  Do you feel the same? (can you feel the pain?)  SKIN HER!!!
*"Slave Hive Meltdown"*Do they dream? These machines have eyes I'm floating! I'm failing! I'm controlled! A new way to fade away Rebuilt and falling apart Failure, frustration Fading suns burn out  I'm asleep in a stream of consciousness Mourning the broken rays of a sun That I've tried to reach since day one  It's just a vanishing dream Between the ports of sorrow And the gates of hell Am I alone in here? Inside its program: Suffocate the last ones Who look at the stars  I try to hide in a safe place Away from their faces Eyes watching me Alive to die for what's greater Plastic creator My river runs free  Beneath my feet: Bodies Make up the gear wheels That keeps me alive Choked on the shit that they feed me And as they kill me I'll die with a smile  Fuck! Weren't we supposed to dream? Then why is all I see these shadowns? Just fucking shadows! Imprisoned within imaginary walls Built with lies and false promises For the sheep that follow Who am I? A peasant given life to choke in this lie All these borders and lines you've drawn in my mind Am I really alive?  I'm asleep in a stream of consciousness Mourning the broken rays of a sun That I've tried to reach since day one  I'm playing their game Just punishing myself For trying to stay alive Access denied I'm not the only one inside my mind My price tag is my birthright For their profit they force me to fight
*"Schlacht"*Under the butcher's knife Life is more present than ever A life that fades away Before I die I'll dream One dream that'll last me forever Forever dead in sleep The green beneath the waves, first time seen By drowning  How could you know? How could you know this was living? Nobody told Nobody told you about living Now you're leaving... DIE!  Like mother Nature rules Survival of the filthiest The maggots make the rules The highest of humans, Still just the lowest of life The rulers in the dirt Look at the world from the eyes of a pig  We all deserve to die! We all deserve to die!! We all deserve to die!!! WE ALL DESERVE TO DIE!!!!  Cannibalism, cannibalism Cannibalism, cannibalism Cannibalism, cannibalism Cannibalism when a swine eats a pig  This is what it'll always come down to Don't you see what you're all doing?

How could you know this was living? Nobody told Nobody told you about living Now you're leaving... DIE!  How could you know? How could you know this was living? Nobody told Nobody told you about living Now you're leaving... DIE!

*"As It Is"*Tears of faith roll down  my face A glimpse into perfection A minute of eternity In absence of rejection A Presence of simplicity Observing all that is In Grace of contemplation serenity and bliss  Matter whirling like a stream Recreating these bodies Consistent it would seem But flowing, not here to stay In your bodily sensations As true as "truth" could be A path to liberation Aware - Just letting be  Feel your pleasure, pain As it goes away - And I say It's not here to stay Just observe... Observe it as it is Try to stop the rain And it'll be in vain Feel your pleasure, pain To Face... To face your own resistance  They can not grasp who you are And neither can you my friend Disguised like the Avatar A mystery of flesh and bones Feel the faith of life refill you Arise and pass away Like dust from distant shores in wind Blowing, Not here to stay - Not here to stay  Who is this You, walking? Was that your Choice? Who is this You, talking? Was that Your voice? Something more, something less? Process of consciousness Nothing more, nothing less? For us to curse, for us to bless  Feel your pleasure, pain As it goes away - And I say It's not here to stay Just observe... Observe it as it is Try to stop the rain And it'll be in vain Feel your pleasure, pain To Face... To face your own resistance  Feel your pleasure, pain As it goes away - And I say It's not here to stay Just observe...

My longing began at one one one three I just realized how hollow I am I came here to taste a drop of your wine And maybe I'll be ready for the dance  The steps are hard And our feet a weary But maybe the dance will make us fly Yet still I'm unable To rise to my knees The chains around my wrists are soft and warm "Soft and tender..."  My longing began at one one one three I just realized how hollow I am I came here to taste a drop of your wine And maybe I'll be ready for the dance  No one has ever cleared my doubt No one has ever given me the answers No one knows the dark I see And no one can see light as I No one dreams the dreams of mine No one commits my sins but me No one has ever seen but You And I know it's true  I'll stand tall as a child And ask for forgiveness No more lies as I hear The voice from the hills  The voice from the hills  My longing began at one one one three I just realized how hollow I am I came here to taste a drop of your wine And maybe I'll be ready for the dance
*"Die With Me"*Floating, into the dark Falling, dreams fall apart I long for, the light of the stars I watch the sky as it falls Caught in a cage I've made myself Self made cage Looking up on the planet rain End of our age  I can not take it on my own I can not take it all alone  As the world comes to an end I ask Will you stand here by my side and cry with me? And as it all falls apart I need To know that you'll stay and die with me  Breathless, turning to stone Helpless, don't leave me alone They're fighting, the voices in me- Keeping me from fighting free But in your arms they all fall in silence And let me sleep In your voice a soothing song Just let me sleep  I can not take it on my own I can not take it all alone  As the world comes to an end I ask Will you stand here by my side and cry with me? And as it all falls apart I need To know that you'll stay and die with me  In the end all I do is a lie ...In the end... In the end all I do is a lie ...In the end... In the end all I do is a lie ...In the end... In the end all I do is a lie ...In the end...

*"Child"*There was a funeral last week, a procession down the street People acted like the circus came to town The choir sang so loud when the casket hit the ground That the tiny bell that rang was all but drowned  She's buried alive Buried alive  A little child stood by the grave and was told that it was brave It's not right to lose one's mother while so young The child was wondering still that if mother was so ill Then who pulled on the string so the bell rung?  She's buried alive Buried alive  Come, let's go outside and play, pretend we ran away I know a secret place in the garden by the maze They keep their curtains closed and we are never told When no one wants to say, will they let our mother stay?  And the silence of the crowd stood in contrast to the sound On the last night when dear mother could still cry There was laughter just before as the child peeked through the door The shadows of her sickness grew too wild  Now she's buried alive Buried alive  Come, let's go outside and play, pretend we ran away I know a secret place in the garden by the maze They keep their curtains closed and we are never told When no one wants to say, will they let our mother stay?  Bring me mother, I can't sleep Child, don't weep, mother's resting Mother will wake up again Bring me mother, I can't sleep Child, don't weep, mother's resting Mother will wake up again  Come, let's go outside and play, pretend we ran away I know a secret place in the garden by the maze They keep their curtains closed and we are never told When no one wants to say, will they let our mother stay?  We'll let our mother sleep

*"Through The Glass"*I thought you'd see me through the glass, But you only caught your reflection. I hoped you'd hear me through the noise, Of the street poles and fire  But no, no, no, You didn't notice.  I tried to care for a while, But I don't feel the connection. I'd settle for a broken heart, Just a scar caused by infection  But no, no, no, I didn't notice, What you wanted All gets lost in the fire That warms who we are, get lost  And we're dressed up like humans, Like we know who we are. This map won't get you home, If you don't know where you are. This plastic house won't break with stones. This road won't get you home, From where you are.  You look like someone from afar, When I knew the direction. I'd settle for a broken heart, Just a scar caused by infection.  But no, no, no, We didn't notice.

*"We're All Alone"*I am your hero Still I sleep alone at night In years you'll thank me For getting everything right I am the sun Still I sit alone in a red sky Keeping my eyes on you Were all alone  In time you'll find that Were all on our own (all on our own) Were all on our own, chasing nothing My dreams have fallen, I'm wearing thin I need something to fill this void I'm constantly in And I can't do this  I am your hero I just don't care tonight In years you'll forget me I got everything right I am the sun I didn't rise today I left you in darkness  And I just don't care anymore about you You can sit and suffer alone without me  I am your hero Save your "thank you's"  In times to come ill rise above this But for now I can't ill just sit here My dreams have fallen once again My dreams have fallen once again  I need something to fill this void I'm in
*"Borrowed Time"*I'm looking back on a time when I could say I actually thought I cared about you But after everything I've been put through I realize I've been living with false hope It's drowning out my senses I realize I've been living with false hope It's drowning out my thoughts  This has gone oh so confusing And I've only got myself to blame I can't believe oh what was I thinking I've only got myself to blame  You mean nothing to me - and you never fucking did  I can't stand to listen to your excuses anymore  I can only pray that you feel so alone And a guilty conscience hangs over your head I can't believe oh what was I thinking And I've only got myself To blame in all of this (We're the only ones to blame)  I've got nothing to depend on Oh I've got nothing to depend on  I realize That I've been living with false hope It's drowning out my senses It's drowning out my thoughts With nothing to depend on anymore  You mean nothing to me - and you never fucking did
*"Every Last Breath"*After all is said and done I'm left with reflections of your eyes Haunting my mind - so dead inside What good came out of this?  I was the one that tore you down I was the one that tore you...  (I'm down) yet oh so guilty (I'm down) Every last breath I have is yours to keep  This constant cloud is watching over me Oh I wish I had the time to make you see this through See this through  We've been here too many times I've felt this too many times We've been here too many times Oh god, I am this  I'm dead On the inside, looking out For you And your final words  This constant cloud is watching over me Oh I wish I had the time to make you see this through This constant cloud is watching over me Oh I wish I had the time to make you see this one through See this one through  And after all is said and done I'm left with reflections of your eyes Haunting my mind I'm so dead inside What good came out of this?  I was the one that tore you down  Down I'm down Yet oh so guilty Now I'm not used to this
*"One Of These Days"*I admire your perseverance!  Everytime my back is turned your falling closer into my world, I've told you so many times you need to back down, need to back down.  I told you you need to walk away. All the countless efforts I have made. One day I'll get you back, I swear I'll get you back.  Will this ever end or will time stand still forever? Will this ever end or will time stand still forever?  Everytime my back is turned you're falling closer to my world. How can you sleep when you know what you're doing to me?  Everytime my back is turned you're falling closer to my world. How can you sleep when you know what you're doing to me?  I told you you need to walk away Fuck all the efforts that I have made. I've got you right where I want you.  After all the years I've known you when did you decide to fuck this up? After all the years I've known you when did you decide to try and fuck this up?  I still admire your perseverance!  How did you think you'd get away with this?!  And it's time to teach you a lesson that you're never gonna fucking forget! You are never gonna forget, not any time soon! You're never gonna forget me! Brargh!
*"Dead March"*I've watched you from a distance but never spoken a word I have seen every flaw your try to hide from the world I sit silent in shadows watching the paths you have made If only you knew my intentions I've watched you make the same mistakes over and over This is not healthy I need to some how stop this But your beauty intrigues me It seems to be pulling me in All I want is a moment or something I can hold close for eternity I've watched you make the same mistakes over and over I only you knew my name and all of my motives Yet I sit in the same place every night and wait for you to come back home A few moments would help me find myself But this problem has taken its tragic grip Just a few moments will help me find myself again If only you knew my name and all of my motives I need to somehow stop this All I need is a moment or something I can hold close for eternity Something I can hold close to me
*"Left With A Last Minute"*It feels like someone is following my every footstep around every corner, And there are times when I know I've felt someone else with me.  I swear I've felt your breath down the back of my neck once before. I swear I've felt your breath down the back of my neck once before.  I'm never giving up till I find you. I'll never rest until I find you.  I refuse to rest and I refuse to sleep until I have you in my sights. It's gone too far. A few steps behind. Where are you now?  What is the meaning, why are you doing this to me? What is the meaning, why are you doing this to me?  How can you do this? I'll never sleep until I find you.  I swear I've felt your presence once before, Or has my paranoia gone far too far?  I can't close my eyes without thinking that I'm losing control! I can't close my eyes without thinking that I'm losing control!  I swear I've felt your breath down the back of my neck once before. I swear I've felt your breath down the back of my neck once before.  I'm never giving up till I find you. I'll never rest until I find you. I'll never rest and I'll never sleep till I get my hands around your neck. It's gone too far. A few steps behind. I'm coming for you now.  All I seem to hear in my head is your voice on repeat, I close my eyes and I still fucking see you. All I seem to hear in my head is your voice on repeat, I close my eyes and I still fucking see you there!
*"Hollow Crown"*There, there must be An easier way To release these feelings  So, so far from home I need your voice To hold my head together  So, so far from home I need your voice To lift my lonely state of mind  You, you can but wait for me to return For me to show you how I felt  These wounds have bled And pages fly by I need to feel you right by my side  So, so far from home I need your voice To hold my head together  So, So far from home I need your voice To lift my lonely state of mind  Oh there must be An easier way Oh there must be An easier way Oh there must be An easier way To release these feelings  As the sea breeze hits my lungs It takes me back to where I belong To where I belong  As the sea breeze hits my lungs It takes me back to where I belong To where I belong  As the sea breeze hits my lungs It takes me back to where I belong To where I belong
*"Day In Day Out"*The years I put into this  It could take a second To tear down years of work And we won't get these days Back again (back again) I can't understand why I've been put here I'm stuck in a world of sympathy With nobody watching over me And the words roll over and over Yet our hearts will never be lifted Someone, tell me how I've ended up here With nobody watching over me? We need to bring back the days we used to love Before all the colour drains away I can't understand why I've been put here I'm stuck in a world of sympathy With nobody watching over me I can't understand why I've been put here I'm stuck in a world of sympathy With nobody watching over me To all those not living in the here and now To all those not living in the here and now To all those not living in the here and now To all those (sing it loud) Where did they go? The days we used to know Where did they go? Have I forgotten what it feels like? Where did they go / where did they go The days we used to know Where did they go / where did they go Have I forgotten what it feels like? And the words roll over and over Yet our hearts will never be lifted
*"Learn To Live"*Picked yourself up, Stop loving, start living, Don't get held back, That's where they want you to be.  I never paid much attention to them.  Every time they pushed us aside, We got back up again, Yeah we made it through the rain, Just to live another day without them.  Pick yourself back up and learn to live, Stop caring, stop thinking. Picked yourself back up and learn to live, The grass is greener on the other side, so don't give up on life.  Never back down, do this for yourself, You don't need anyone to get you where you deserve.  I never paid much attention to them.  Every time they push us aside, We jump back up again, Yeah, we made it through the rain, Just to live another day without them.  Every time they push us aside, We jump back up again, Yeah, we made it through the rain, Just to live another day without them.  We are the ones you left out in the rain, Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again. We are the ones you left out in the rain, Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again.  We are the ones you left out in the rain, Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again. We are the ones you left out in the rain, Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again.  Here again...  We made it through the rain just to live another day, We made it through the rain just to live another day, We made it through the rain just to live another day, We made it through the rain, the rain.
*"Delete, Rewind"*We are the misguided youth. They backed us into a corner. All our lives we've been infected, They should have never of had a chance.  Because they're forcing us to believe, In a world we shouldn't trust. Delete rewind, And try to change this state of mind.  Give us something to believe in, Give us something to make our own, Give us something to believe in, Give us something to make our own.  When we will we stand up and choose our paths?  This is the end of the world, At least that's what we're told. This is the end of the world, Board up your windows and lock the doors.  Turn out the lights, turn out the lights, Oh, this is getting old.  We are the misguided youth, We sat back and lost our voices.  Delete rewind, Try to change this state of mind, Delete rewind, And try to change this...  Because they're pushing us to the left, In a world we shouldn't trust. Delete rewind, And try to change this state of mind.  I don't believe you knew it all, you knew it all along. Delete rewind, delete rewind.  When will we stand up, We've been through enough. When will we stand up, How'd we let them get the best of us?  When will we stand up, We've been through enough. When will we stand up, How'd we let them take the best of us?
*"BTN"*It's run down The back of my head The back of my mind About a hundred thousand times And I can't Seem to shake it Seem to shake it Addiction's tying me down  Pull me under I can't take it much longer Pull me under And it will never stop  You've got a hold on me Like a constant need inside for nicotine I've been through this patch before You've got a hold on me Like a constant need inside for nicotine I've been through this patch before I've been through this patch before  I'm lost and alone in my head And I can't make sense of myself I need to find a simple away To make this pain just disappear I know I'll never feel Safe in my own skin  Pull me under I can't take it much longer Pull me under And it will never stop  You've got a hold on me Like a constant need inside for nicotine I've been through this patch before  You've got a hold on me Like a constant need inside for nicotine I've been through this patch before  No matter how long I'm gone for It's at the back of my mind Another sleepless night Somebody get me home  I'm so far down And there's nothing anyone can say to me I'm so down, I'm so down  You've got a hold on me Like a constant need inside for nicotine I've been through this patch before
*"An Open Letter To Myself"*Always the one with a face on Always the one with never enough He was the boy that broke your trust Because he was never around enough We sit around and hear these stories Wishing we were somewhere else How I wish that I could find the words to save this  My so called friend My so called friend When will we see you again  I was the one with the face on I was the one with never enough I was the boy that broke your trust Because I was never around enough I sit around and tell these stories Wishing I was somewhere else Oh how I wish I found the words to save this  My so called friend My so called friend  I wish I found the words to save this Im pushing it out, out Find the words to save this Im pushing it out, out, out  My so called friend My so called friend When will we see you again  My so called friend My so called friend When will we see you again When will we see you again
*"The Blues"*Never, never lose sight Of what you started it for No matter what comes in between  And I used to think That I knew better than those around me But something changed along the way And youre the reason Im wanting to stay  I used to sink and now I swim Ive had to work for everything  When will you recognize your it, youre the reason I feel so alive And none else comes in between  I used to think That I knew better than those around me But something changed along the way And youre the reason Im wanting to stay  I cant turn my back and leave you After all youve done for me I cant turn my back and leave you After all youve done for me  The blues have wrapped their arms Around me and I cant make sense of it The blues have wrapped their arms Around me I wish it was you instead The blues have wrapped their arms Around me and I cant make sense of it The blues have wrapped their arms Around me  Oh how I wish it was you instead  I never knew I could feel like this  The blues have wrapped their arms Oh how I wish it was you instead The blues have wrapped their arms Oh how I wish it was you instead The blues have wrapped their arms Oh how I wish it was you instead
*"Red Eyes"*I can't seem to get a hold of this This mess seems to be taking It's grasp on every Everything that we once worked for And I can't bear to watch Everything just fall around me,  And I've been struggling for so long, so long And I've been looking for a way To make everything just fall into place  And when the red glazes over my eyes There's nothing anyone can say or do Just you try and stop me Try and stop what I've become How I wish there was a way.  And I've been struggling for so long, so long And I've been looking for a way To make everything just fall into place  Everything just fall into place Every word I ever said Is making sense again When the red glazes over my eyes There's nothing anyone can say or, say or do  And still today I cannot tell Dreams from nightmares anymore And still today I cannot tell Dreams from nightmares anymore And still today cannot tell Dreams from nightmares anymore  And I've been struggling for so long, so long And I've been looking for a way To make everything just fall into place  If you reject the ones you love, You'll find yourself torn and broken again If you reject the ones you love, You'll find yourself torn and broken again If you reject the ones you love, You'll find yourself torn and broken again If you reject the ones you love, You'll find yourself torn and broken again
*"Stay Young Forever"*You've done this to yourself or so, so it seems You left behind everything All your friends and all your family Does it not feel slightly daunting How you still sleep at night When you must be able to hear them fight It's all about you All about you All about the way you choose to live  You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough  How did it come to this  Is there any point to this, are you even listening to us  You still left everyone you loved Crushed, broken, snapped straight in half You still left everyone you loved Crushed, broken, snapped straight in half  You made your choice now turn and get out You made your choice now turn and get out  How do you sleep at night It's all about you, it's all about you How do you sleep at night It's all about you, it's all about you  You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough  You left every one you loved Crushed Broken Snapped straight in half
*"Heartburn"*Burn everything you have And leave it all behind Lose all your inhibitions I'll take the mess you made And I'll make it beautiful Oh if time only stood still forever  Ohhh  Hold out your hand And lean upon me I'll be the one to make you smile Hold out your hand And lean upon me I'll be the one to make you smile again Hold out your hand And lean upon me I'll be the one to make you smile Hold out your hand And lean upon me I'll be the one to make you smile again  This moment that we're in Is slow and disappointing Time will never stand still for ever If you take this chance we've got We can make it beautiful If you'd take my word I'd be your saviour  Hold out your hand And lean upon me I'll be the one to make you smile Hold out your hand And lean upon me I'll be the one to make you smile again Hold out your hand And lean upon me I'll be the one to make you smile Hold out your hand And lean upon me I'll be the one to make you smile again  Hold out your hand And lean upon me  Hold out your hand And lean upon me  Hold out your hand And lean upon me  Hold out your hand And lean upon me  Ohhhhhhhh  Burn everything you have And leave it all behind Lose all your inhibitions I took the mess you made And I made it beautiful Oh if time only stood still forever Forever
*"Year In Year Out / Up And Away"*Im astounded Im looking for a reason to leave Im astounded Im looking for a reason to leave The years Ive put into everything I have Everything I am  Im needing to find some peace of mind To stop me leaving it all behind These eyes have seen everything But Ill keep looking  Its time to realise that my head Is trying to take me down Its time to realise that my head Is trying to push Trying to push me out  Im screaming out for help Months Years Nobody hears Im screaming out, Im screaming out Its time to realise that my head Is trying to take me down Im screaming out to no-one  Im astounded still looking for a reason to leave Im astounded still looking for a reason to leave  The years Ive put into everything I have now The years that Ive put into I am now  Im needing to find some peace of mind To stop me leaving it all behind These eyes have seen everything But Ill keep looking  Its time to take a step back Look at my life and Find a stable place to hide Its time to take a step back Look at my life and find A stable place to hide Its time to take a step back Look at my life and Find a stable place to hide Stable place to hide  Live everyday like your last And take nothing for granted Ill live everyday like my last And Ill take none of this for granted   Love as you want to be loved And live the way that you know you should Keep the good ones by your side You never know when they might fly up and away  Forever in mind, my mind Ill be by your, your side Forever in my mind, youll be there
*"The Bitter End"*When time resets, we all become zero. Decimals apart, take us back to the start. Tear down the walls, that were built to divide. Can you feel that fire growing? We're standing on the edge of the event horizon, Moments before the Earth starts to flatline.
*"Alpha Omega"*The Son of God Hangman's pawn control our lives With fairtytales and shallow lies.  You say we'll burn in hell. Spiteful preacher, I know you well.  Desperation breathes and follows you home, Just look around, you're not alone.  One life. One chance. The world in front of me.  Intelligent design. Sending shivers down my spine. Cells mutate and divide, What a sadistic intention.  No light, no dark. No ups, no downs. I'll find peace, buried in the ground. The lights go out, the fuse has blown, No heaven or hell to bring me home.  You say we'll burn in hell. Spiteful preacher, I know you well.  Desperation breathes and follows you home, Just look around, you're not alone.  One life. One chance. The world in front of me.  Another division to tear us apart. Try to fill that hole inside your heart.  Another division to tear us apart. Try to fill that hole inside your heart.  Son of God, son in the sky. If you could speak, I'm sure you'd say: "There's more to me than meets the eye. There's more to me, There's more to me! "  Son of God, son in the sky. If you could speak, I'm sure you'd say: "There's more to me than meets the eye. There's more to me, There's more to me! "  Let me say my decency comes from inside. Just human heart, a decent mind, We all slip up from time to time.  Let me say my decency comes from inside. Just human heart, a decent mind. We all slip up from time to time.
*"These Colours Don't Run"*These streets aren't paved with gold Don't believe everything that you're told Deception hides in all you see Corruption hangs in the air that you breathe And in the land of the free You know nothing comes for free Fourth drive in paradise Vapid souls check the market price Life time slave Living in a suburban grave If there was a god, was a god You would be the death of him  These colours don't run Like colours from the face Eyes roll back chemical despair It's true what they say life isn't fair  So repeat this line, everything, everything is fine. [x2]  These colours don't run Like colours from the face Eyes roll back chemical despair It's true what they say life isn't fair  And in the land of the free You know nothing comes for free  I'm struggling to find any poetry in this Someone beat me to the line ignorance is bliss So I guess I'll just say it how it is You had it all, you fucking pigs!  These streets aren't paved with gold Don't believe everything that you're told Deception hides in all you see Corruption hangs in the air you breathe
*"Daybreak"*Navigation in nautical twilight, Separation from what we know is right. The wind was taking us in the wrong direction, It's about time we showed some disaffection. Carry the weight of thousands of years. Turn the page, let's make it all disappear. We've had enough of inhibited progression, Held back by cloak and dagger oppression. We're insulting our own intelligence. I won't listen without any evidence. I'll live my life in the name of no one. Bow your head, palm to palm, Worship here in this cerebral cathedral. As day breaks, the sunlight heals, As day breaks, the light reveals. These chains that we've been living in, How easily we've been giving in. Now she'd this skin, let change begin. As day breaks, the sunlight heals, As day breaks, the light reveals. Navigation in nautical twilight, Separation from what we know is right. It feels to me like this boat is sinking, Weighed down by rational thinking. Light begins to pierce the distance. Solar dawn, relieve the friction. Blue hours quicken the pulse. Upon the upper edge, reality dawns.
*"Truth, Be Told"*Raging waters flood the valleys of our mind. The torrent washed away the warning signs.  Swim through the ones and zeros, So hard to tell the villains from heroes.  What if they say isn't true? What if they want isn't best for you?  Washed up, face down on digital shore. Lungs contract, now dive back in for more. Are you sitting on the edge of your seat? We'll be right back, don't move an inch, don't move an inch.  Swim through the ones and zeros, So hard to tell the villians from heros.  Static mirror, life isn't black and white. I understand it's hard to chose what's right. Whiteout swallows us all. Once snow-blind, we won't care at all.  What if they say isn't true? What if they want isn't best for you, best for you..?  Tunnel vision, Hearts beat in time. Rhythmic contractions Drowning in a flood of distractions.  I want to wake up and find a world in remission, Free from the grasp of the human condition. But we're all trapped inside static screens, Trained from birth just to nod and agree. I don't want to believe, That we'll be forever fast asleep.  Swim through the ones and zeros, So hard to tell the villains from heroes.  Static mirror, life isn't black and white. I understand it's hard to chose what's right. Whiteout swallows us all. Once snow-blind, we won't care at all.  What if they say isn't true? What if they want isn't best for you?
*"Even If You Win, You're Still A Rat"*Your life is ending one minute at a time Check the clock and stand in line. Hibernate 'til your life's passed you by. Please stop living like you're waiting to die.  Keep up, keep up, Don't get left behind Don't slip up, slip up Chase that finish line They don't want you believing That your life deserves a meaning.  Weary souls trying to forget. That we're all puppets with a lifetime debt.  What a feeling built to break, Happiness with an expire date. Please stop living like you're waiting to die.  Please stop living like you're waiting to die.  Stitched into our lives Drained until we expire.  Weary souls trying to forget That we're all puppets with a lifetime debt. We're all weary souls trying to forget.  Keep two eyes on that intangible finish line. In this race we're all reduced to vermin. Keep two eyes on that intangible finish line. In this race we're all reduced, we're all reduced to vermin.  Stitched into our lives. Drained until we expire. Your life is ending one minute at a time.  Weary souls trying to forget That we're puppets with a lifetime debt.
*"Outsider Heart"*I close my eyes and take a deep breath, try to find my place in this. Digging teeth into the hand that feeds, so inhuman, Im surprised you bleed. Cutting teeth, fading belief. Flip the switch and drag me in. When theyve had their way, I doubt Ill even dream. Stray from the path and youre on your own. Lightening strikes in the unknown. The view from here, even the blind would see, that none of us were ever free. Ill be the lines in-between, the ones that tell you what you want and need. I am only rust on the machine, amber corrosion. The loudest truth you never heard, a silent explosion. Take my head from the clouds, lift my feet from the ground, Last note dies, they dont make a sound.
*"Behind The Throne"*Sowing the seeds. Roots dig deep, whilst we sleep. Snakes in veins, valves decay. All of the meaningless words we say. Cast the first stone, from behind the throne. Crown of thorns, now overgrown. All our wants and needs, bring us to our knees. Cant turn back now the seeds are sown. Seven billion, one of a kind. Collide together, intertwined. National lines used to define, where we draw the enemy lines. Weapons arent used in this war. Wait for the fallout from this absence of thought. All the things we cant afford to ignore. The sun doesnt shine anymore.
*"Devil's Island"*This is your country, This is your home, Here is the house where you grew up alone.  The city streets, You used to love, Are bruised and broken, Are black and blue. On our TV's, miles away. On our doorsteps with no reason why.  Take it back, take it back, take it back.  This is your country, This is your home, Here is the house where you grew up alone. Remember this for what it was.  Take it back, take it back, take it back.  You want a voice, But your voices sound like violence. You don't deserve this life.  This is your country, This is your home, Here is the house where you grew up alone. Remember this for what it was, A bleak projection of absent minds.  You want a voice, But your voices sound like violence. You shout so loud but all I hear is silence. The city streets that you show no love, Are bruised and broken, Because of you.  This is your country, This is your home, Here is the house where you grew up alone.  Remember this for what it was.
*"Feather Of Lead"*The sick get sicker while the rich get richer. Capital greed paired with vestigial superstition. The sick get sicker while the rich get richer. Angels and demons, money and munitions. Your left wing clipped, buy a gun for jesus. Opportunities for all those willing to pay. Out of sight, out of mind, too afraid of the horror that you might find. Out of sight, out of mind. How much does your faith cost? Celestial shepherd watches over his flock. What about those black sheep that he forgot? Unanswered faith is everything that theyve got. Id like to think youre everything that Im not. Something here doesnt add up. Your charity starts and ends at home. Your conscience called but you hung up the phone.
*"Unbeliever"*Our story began in the heart, In the heart of a star. We've lost our way, forgotten what we are. We are only particles in motion. Floating through space, a destructive race. What a destructive race.  Look at this life as a grain of sand, the blink of an eye, a world in your hands. Look at this life as a grain of sand, the blink of an eye. We're all thinking, feeling, surviving, believing In what we think is right, refract distorted light. You helped build this fire inside of me. Breathing fire won't burn down the borders, Set against everything that came before us. All those things that you despise, We all see through human eyes.  Thinking, feeling, surviving, believing In what we think is right, refract distorted light. You helped build this fire inside of me. Breathing fire won't burn down the borders, Set against everything that came before us. There is no side for us to choose, Bound together, we all win or all lose.  Look at this life as a grain of sand, the blink of an eye, a world in your hands. Look at this life as a grain of sand, the blink of an eye, a world in your hands.  Oh, life is so short. Take a moment to feel alive. I know all we meant was to expand and to thrive. But we sharpened our claws and we went to war. With ourselves, with each other, with the rich and with the poor. With anyone different, who believes in less or more. Step out of the shadow, cast by left and right wings. Take refuge in each other and the triumph that it brings. Since we stood on two feet, we've been worth so much more. Now tear down the walls, that were built to divide, It's time to extinguish that fire, That fire inside.
*"Rise Against"*Resist, rise against Tuning out the message they sent Waking up, things never felt so clear All of it ceased, I want it to pass  Armed to the teeth With words that give me some meaning  Cover up the mistakes that you made You better believe this feeling won't fade Digging deep, there's a long way to go But there's some things that we want you to know These pills must be bitter to swallow What despair waits for us tomorrow? This is only a matter of time One day you're gonna pay for your crime  Armed to the teeth With words that give me some meaning Oh, I'm wide awake, but I'm still dreaming I'm still dreaming  I'll clinch my name, I'm fading now But we're not ready just to lay down and die The clouds are smoke signals, so you'll find your way Spread the word of the mess that we're in This is a chance to live through my end  I'm wide awake, but I still hear you  Armed to the teeth With words that give me some meaning Oh, I'm wide awake, but I'm still dreaming I'm still dreaming
*"Cracks In The Earth"*In the bigger picture I've been painted out Cracks in the earth blacken the sea No canvas is reserved for me Look up close and try to see In every stroke lies past alone  Too close to home Cutting too close to bone The ink has dried and words reveal Too close to home Cutting too close to the bone It's too easy to admit defeat  You aren't a child fighting in a war Son please don't tell me that this is bored Tear your things out from the earth Long departed we're so short sighted  Too close to home Cutting too close to bone The ink has dried and words reveal Too close to home Cutting too close to the bone It's too easy to admit defeat  Too close to home Cutting too close to bone The ink has dried and words reveal Too close to home Cutting too close to the bone It's too easy to admit defeat
*"Untitled"*The long walk home, Back to a no name town. Where people pass me by In red and white lines. Your only son can't make you proud. The moon and stars, this frozen clock.  [x2:] And if in years to come we can talk like friends, Can I close my eyes and wake up then?  Drown out the sound of adulthood With songs that fell from out of space. At seventeen I wouldn't dare to dream Because hope's a dangerous thing, Hope's a dangerous thing.  I won't thank God, I'll thank my friends, For sticking by till we're home again. What matters most to me belongs to you. Because hope's a dangerous thing, Hope's a dangerous thing.  [x2:] I pinch myself to see, That if this curtain drops, this isn't me. Pack my bags, no time to waste. We leave no trace of us. Still my pillow rings.  Still my pillow rings.
*"Black Blood"*We've found a taste for self-destruction A blind eye for blatant dysfunction We've found a taste for self-destruction We're all born in black blood  There's an imminence stirring like a siren singing There's a debt to pay but they keep on drilling Why is simple truth so hard to tell We had eden and turned it into hell  Born in black blood  Because this distance in our minds Is the distance that we're behind I can't forgive, we won't forget I can't forgive, we won't forget  The lonely sound of the final drip Like the starting gun marking the end of it On the shoulders of forever It's a long way to fall Black gold will be the death The death of us all  Black drought, word will spread Of the time we found what the earth bled  Born in black blood  Because this distance in our minds Is the distance that we're behind I can't forgive, we won't forget I can't forgive, we won't forget [x2]  Black drought, word will spread Of the time we found what the earth bled We found the cancer inside of our heads There's no turning back now We're as good as dead  When the well dried up no one cared But when hell shows up, they'll all stop and stare [x2]  We've found the cancer inside of our heads No turning back now We're as good as dead [x2]  I can't forgive, we won't forget [x4]  We won't forget
*"Blood Bank"*Well, I met you at the blood bank We were looking at the bags Wondering if any of the colours Matched any of the names we knew on the tags  You said "see look, that's yours Stacked on top with your brother's See how they resemble one another Even in their plastic little covers"  And I said I know it well  That secret that you knew But don't know how to tell It fucks with your honour And it teases your head But you know that it's good, girl 'Cause its running you with red  Then the snow started falling We were stuck out in your car You were rubbing both of my hands Chewing on a candy bar  You said "ain't this just like the present To be showing up like this" As a moon waned to crescent We started to kiss  And I said I know it well  That secret that we know That we don't know how to tell I'm in love with your honour I'm in love with your cheeks What's that noise up the stairs babe? Is that Christmas morning creaks?  And I know it well And I know it well And I know it well And I know it well And I know it well And I know it well And I know it well And I know it well And I, I know it well And I, I know it well And I, I know it well And I, I know it well I know it well And I, I know it well
*"Of Dust And Nations"*The towers that shoulder your pride The words you've written in stone Sand will cover them, sand will cover you The streets that suffer your name Your very flesh and your bones Sand will cover them, sand will cover you  So put your faith in more than steel Don't store your treasures up, with moth and rust Where thieves break in and steal Pull the fangs from out your heel Oh we live in but a shadow of the real  Step out from time and see the dust of nations Step out from time and hear the stars ovation Saturn will not sleep, until the sand has made us clean Still we stack our stones and bury what we can But it all will be undone, and nothing built under the sun Will ever stand before the endless march of sand  So put your faith in more than steel Don't store your treasures up, with moth and rust Where thieves break in and steal Pull the fangs from out your heel Oh we live in but a shadow of the real  So put your faith in more than steel Don't store your treasures up, with moth and rust Where thieves break in and steal Pull the fangs from out your heel Oh we live in but a shadow of the real
*"Gravedigger"*An iron fist in a velvet glove Another vulture posing as a dove So you have no shame? Look at what you've become You are the reason we are bitter and then some  They sing of saviours, we sing of sorrow But we're still holding on for dear life  You sold us all down the river I hope you choke on the vows that you failed to deliver You said you'd change the world, but death still flies east The blind lead the blind, so we bomb for peace  Grave digger, there's blood on your hands You built this empire on salt and sand Not all is fair in love and war History repeats, we've seen this all before  We've given the vampires the keys to the blood bank  They say the more things change, the more they stay the same Whilst the liars leech, the crooked preach So lie through your teeth, lie like you mean it It beggars belief, do you really think that we still fucking believe it?

*"Naysayer"*Say what you like, I know what I am Sometimes a flood starts with a leak in the dam You said we'll never make a difference Maybe this battle is to fight indifference  Naysayer  Naysayer, hammer the nail We're all on our own, we can't decide what's true Betrayer, hammer the nail Such narrow lines separate me and you  So sick of the sound of people giving up You can't stop me giving a fuck  Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on  With every concession another piece of us dies Will we fight for nothing, if not our lives?

*"Broken Cross"*God only knows why we were born to burn  If God is my witness, he'll see that all is not well Christ, what a sight for sore eyes Looking down on us, all the children that you despise  God only knows why we were born to burn God only knows why we were born to burn  A bullet in the neck doesn't feel much like love A message of rejection sent from above No flags, no holy books I'll be in hell with the misunderstood  The sons and daughters that you wished to forget A desperate picture of god's regret Are we perfect mistakes?

*"The Devil Is Near"*They live this day and night This is sacrifice, no fucking compromise They have the heart to resist Whilst the hunters hunt, they will persist  This is where tragedy is bought and sold It seems their pain is worth it's weight in gold You know they're here when the water is red Our fading life support is hanging by a thread  A message etched on broken ships  They live this day and night This is sacrifice, no fucking compromise They have the heart to resist Whilst the hunters hunt, they will persist  You can hear them cry, they're calling out For the mother lost, she's bleeding out  Their innocence is heaven sent This malevolence, it will not relent A graveyard sits upon the shore They won't swim together anymore  The tide will rush with waves of fear Selling souls, the devil is near  A message etched on broken ships We'll be here till corruption quits There is a voice, though they cannot speak Not yet ready to admit defeat.  You can hear them cry, they're calling out For the mother lost, she's bleeding out  This is where tragedy is bought and sold It seems their pain is worth it's weight in gold
*"Dead Man Talking"*These martyrs seek no adoration No promises of god's salvation They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet They hung the heroes  You've got to watch your back You've got to swallow fear Cover your tracks, or you might disappear  They found the words to speak unspeakable things They struck the air from the chests of kings  These martyrs seek no adoration No promises of god's salvation They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet They hung the heroes  If you were caught between the devil and the deep blue sea Would you run and hide? Or stand for what you believe? Maybe Orwell was right all along They think this spells the end, it's only just begun  These martyrs seek no adoration No promises of god's salvation They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet They hung the heroes  If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun Swear that you won't forget  Tell the rats to get back in the gutter  We'll be watching, we're always watching  You try to stamp them out You'll only fan the flames This is for all the snakes: Fuck you So hold your forked tongues You've got us spitting nails I'm gonna to say it straight  Fuck you  If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun Swear that you won't forget  They think this spells the end, it's only just begun
*"Red Hypergiant"*The old appeals To racial, sexual, and religious chauvinism, and to rabid nationalist fervor Are beginning not to work  A new consciousness is developing which sees the Earth as a single organism,  and recognizes that an organism at war with itself is doomed We are one planet.
*"C.A.N.C.E.R"*No one knows permanence quite like you There's a ruthlessness in all that you do  This is not about what we deserve There's no bias in the misery served   C.A.N.C.E.R   So watch the sun sink into the sea There is a perfect peace but don't wait up for me  When we all fade away And this world can't bare another day There will be no fight in broken bliss  I feel it now more than ever A reaper's watch My life ready to sever  Your name carries more than disease  A symbol of man brought to his knees  This is not about what we deserve There's no bias in the misery served   C.A.N.C.E.R   When we all fade away And this world can't bare another day There will be no fight in broken bliss  Find a little light and hold it close Don't lose sight of what matters most  This is a burden we all carry together Waiting in the wings, so we never say never  When we all fade away And this world can't bare another day There will be no fight in broken bliss  So watch the sun sink into the sea There is a perfect peace but don't wait up for me  C.A.N.C.E.R   This is a burden we all carry together Waiting in the wings, so we never say never
*"Colony Collapse"*Dear, oh dear, what a sorry state we're in We brought the battle We saw the signs Now we've found ourselves two steps behind I'm counting days like they're running out There's ghosts in the water, so prey for drought  This time there's no where to hide We're facing the firing squad side by side  1986 This is full relapse Our latest apocalypse This is colony collapse  Give us the rope and we'll tie our own noose We truly believed all we touched turned to gold We were warned but we wouldn't be told  I'm counting days like they're running out There's ghosts in the water, so prey for drought  This time there's no where to hide We're facing the firing squad side by side  They said that the ocean's on fire Say it isn't true The truth never hurt so much Can we start anew?  1986 This is full relapse Our latest apocalypse This is colony collapse  Dear, oh dear, what a sorry state we're in  They said that the ocean's on fire Say it isn't true The truth never hurt so much Can we start anew?

*"Castles In The Air"*This is the be all, the end all The burden, the blessing  I've made promises that I know I can't keep Drink from the holy grail, you'll find it's bittersweet No matter what he says, poison is not my friend But he'll have my back until the bitter end   Always climbing but only ever descending The canvas before me is never ending  So call for the crossroads if you're lost in the woods If I drop this torch then I'll be gone for good  I said "enough is enough" Well I guess I lied  This is the be all, the end all The burden, the blessing  All my mistakes will outlive me I just can't accept that what will be, will be My lungs are failing I can't catch my breath I don't know why  But right now I'm scared to death  My fear still sees, when my eyes are closed But the blames on me, this is the path I chose  Always climbing but only ever descending The canvas before me is never ending  So call for the crossroads if you're lost in the woods If I drop this torch then I'll be gone for good  I said "enough is enough" Well I guess I lied  I wasted time building castles in the air If there's peace to be found, I won't find it there. My fear still sees, when my eyes are closed But the blames on me, this is the path I chose
*"Youth Is Wasted On The Young"*The past is dead I walk the funeral march and I will make my peace  If we stop the clock, will I reappear? Pulled from the drift There goes another year  The stars align, the planets shift All the infinite moments that we've missed  There's parts of me that are lost forever At least we're all lost together We all remember youth like it's dead and gone Like our favourite line, from a forgotten song  I'll show you my hurt and I'll show you my heart A life lost in the dark  The past is dead I walk the funeral march and I will make my peace  When I reach the end, will I beg for more? Will I look back? Or step through the door? I stand beneath a monolith Do you ever feel like you won't be missed?  There's parts of me that are lost forever At least we're all lost together I heard that this was only a ride So there's no worth in waiting for death to arrive  All we are, is just a name, it's all we are Our skin, it shows, these crippled bones Youth sinks alone  I'll show you my hurt and I'll show you my heart A life lost in the dark.  There's parts of me that are lost forever At least we're all lost together
*"The Distant Blue"*That distant blue, thats me and you It was from there that we all grew Framed in space, our first home All those beating hearts That were made of stone We were disaster built from flesh and bone  Their bodies made a mountain, a ladder to the stars When they reached up to the sun, it only left them with scars All the saints and the sinners will reap what they sow So they stood back and watched their bitterness grow  They couldn't tell the cure from disease They no longer knew their want from their need They fucked the future, forgot the past Nothing built was built to last  A common ground, now we see  That connected us like the land and the sea  That distant blue, thats me and you It was from there that we all grew Framed in space, our first home All those beating hearts That were made of stone We were disaster built from flesh and bone  Caught in a web, don't struggle free This is all we've got, so just let it be If we save ourselves, we'll feel so small We'll ask ourselves why we cared at all
*"The Shadow Of Doubt"*Fuck Happiness or a broken bottle This is all that we'll want to see tomorrow You'll never know, what comes next Still we'll never trust Hands around our necks Around our necks Blegh  Cross your fingers and hope for the best Count the lights on the wall, try to get some rest  Everyone feels like they carry a curse If we lose control, we wont be the first  The road is lost and you start to slip When you hit the edge, the scales chip The world might turn, upside down The night my passion finds another town  We count on lucky stars, one day they'll open up We live day by day in a shadow of doubt While the motion slows, as we collide While I see my life... Flash before my eyes  You'll never know, what comes next Still we'll never trust Hands around our necks
*"Untitled II"*Believe in yourself Believe in each other Believe that we're nothing more Than sisters and brothers Believe that together We can change for the best Believe that these words are more than wasted breath Are more than wasted breath
*"Nihilist"*We are beggars We are so fucking weak And once upon a time we had the world at our feet Well, we're all dying to meet our maker But all our Gods have abandoned us  All our Gods have abandoned us  This is the great esoteric depression We sold our souls but couldn't buy salvation We are all the shades of misery The reigning champions of tragedy They use their faith as a weapon They count our sins by the seven Blackwater at the gates of heaven  All hail the corporatocracy The word of God written in binary All hail our apostasy The dying notes in an unholy symphony  All our Gods have abandoned us  This is the great esoteric depression We sold our souls but couldn't buy salvation  I found God clutching a razor blade He said "Look at the fucking mess they've made They'd trade their hearts if they were made of gold."  We are beggars We are so fucking weak And once upon a time we had the world at our feet Well, we're all dying to meet our maker But all our Gods have abandoned us  All our Gods have abandoned us  All our Gods have abandoned us  I found God clutching a razor blade He said "Look at the fucking mess they've made They'd trade their hearts if they were made of gold But they're as worthless as the souls they sold."
*"Deathwish"*There was a time for change I fear it came and went Who's gonna pick up the pieces? Who will be left to repent? The sun is burnt out black Now there's no turning back Now there's no turning back  Yeah, I know you know That we've been living a lie Turn a blind eye Until the day we die Maybe we've passed the point of no return Maybe we just want to watch the world burn We just want to watch the world burn  Our collapse will be remission A planet scarred beyond all recognition Suicide in slow motion, is this the path that we've chosen? Too cowardly to face this, we've got a fucking death wish  You want to play with fire?

*"Phantom Fear"*Contaminated Nothing is sacred Born and bred on pure hatred Cause they haunt our streets with a phantom fear No one is safe, no one is welcome here No one is welcome here  Can you taste the poison in the air?

*"Downfall"*They want all for one and none for all I want to be there to witness the downfall  Theyll only sell us out once our backs are turned And well keep paying the price until our lesson is learnt So cast your votes Watch them shed their skin Every snake has its price If the moneys on the table they dont think twice So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin  We are paralysed  But there are none so blind as those who will not see Whats it going to take to get us to stand up? Cause you can see it in their eyes, they dont give a fuck About what matters to us  Another faceless figure, an empty silhouette Theyll line their pockets and leave us six feet deep in debt So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin Always out for blood, praying on the weak We can count on them to paint the future bleak But were still standing by whilst they bleed us dry  We are paralysed  But there are none so blind as those who will not see Whats it going to take to get us to stand up?

*"Gone With The Wind"*The weight of the world is resting on thin ice When the surface breaks will I find paradise? As I freeze to death, left to reflect What a waste of time I was, in retrospect  I'd take a leap of faith, but I'd lose my nerve In the end, I'll get the hell that I deserve  I'm always gone with the wind Crawling in and out of my mind God knows, I lost all my faith  A sickness with no remedy, except the ones inside of me You ever wonder how deep you could sink into nothing at all?

Beneath the ruin lies a story of the lives lost Now were gone, left without a trace But we took something they cannot replace  A match made in heaven, paved the road to hell Weve been down this path before Cold blooded retribution So fuck your revolution  You chew up peace and spit it out as war Youve been feeding the wolf thats waiting at the door You are rotten to the core We found your fingerprints all over the trigger If youre looking for tyrants, take a look in the mirror You knew all along, that the cancer would spread, so dont be surprised to find a price on your head Sorry son, but we destroyed your home, we murdered your family, now youre on your own Collateral damage, face down in the sand Watch the dominoes fall, its all just part of the plan  A match made in heaven Paved the road to hell Weve been down this path before Cold blooded retribution So fuck your revolution  A match made in heaven Paved the road to hell Weve been down this path before And every execution, the price of your collusion  You knew all along, that the cancer would spread, so dont be surprised to find a price on your head  Tell me was it all worth it, to watch your kingdom grow?

*"Gravity"*This is a wake-up call No rise without the fall Facing the great divide You can run but you can't hide You can run but you can't hide  I met the devil and God and couldn't tell them apart I thought I found the end But it was only the start  I've heard it all before Aren't you tired of all of the violence inside of you?

*"All Love Is Lost"*The workers all march to the beat of the drum. Their spirits are broken,  They have nowhere to run.  They dream of courage and a loaded gun,  But the slaves all know,  They better bite their tongue. Track marks across the planet.  Are there any veins left for them to infect? They would kill one another just to disconnect.   Three cheers for desperation. God bless the Godforsaken. We will arm them to the teeth, To fight, to fight the war on peace.  All love is lost, so carry the cross. 'Cause there's no human in us left. We are music made for the deaf. They play a game that they know they'll never win.  Sick and tired of the world they're living in. The messiah showed up high on heroin. On heroin.  The workers all march to the beat of the drum. They fell into the trap, taken one by one. The medicine is poison, but it makes them numb. 'Cause all that they feel is pain and regret. Existence is just something they would rather forget.   Three cheers for desperation. God bless the Godforsaken. We will arm them to the teeth, To fight, to fight the war on peace.  All love is lost, so carry the cross. 'Cause there's no human in us left. We are music made for the deaf. They play a game that they know they'll never win.  Sick and tired of the world they're living in. The messiah showed up high on heroin. On heroin.  Is this freedom? Is this the life you chose? If this is living the dream, we've hit an all-time low.  All love is lost, so carry the cross. 'Cause there's no human in us left. We are music made for the deaf. They play a game that they know they'll never win.  Sick and tired of the world they're living in. The messiah showed up high on heroin. On heroin.
*"From The Wilderness"*There is no end game, so whisper the truth and pass on the blame. Just put us out of our misery. This defeat is a victory. We're burning out, we're fading away. A failed evolution.  Is the problem the solution that they've been searching for?  We're waiting for the world to save itself. 'Cause nothing is built to last. We're writing our epitaph.  So reset and start again. 'Cause we all know how this ends, Before long we'll be dead and gone.  A thorn in the side of the earth. Where do you draw the line? A flaw in the design. The rest is history. This defeat is a victory. We're burning out, we're fading away.  We're all guilty as sin. I feel it, I feel it under my skin. Always up in arms, without lifting a finger. Lifting a finger.  We may be infinite, but this world is not.  Something that we once knew, that we long forgot.  We're waiting for the world to save itself. 'Cause nothing is built to last. We're writing our epitaph.  So reset and start again. 'Cause we all know how this ends, Before long we'll be dead and gone.  We're all guilty as sin. I feel it, I feel it under my skin. Always up in arms, without lifting a finger. Lifting a finger.  We may be infinite, but this world is not.  Something that we once knew, that we long forgot.
*"Memento Mori"*As above, so below Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease As within, so without The seasons bring relief Let me live and die in peace  I will be consumed, returned into the earth Only passing through, nothing left to hold on to Like the thaw against the snow, into the undertow Cut the chord and cast me out Cast me out  It's a promise that you cannot break Was your life worth dying for? The universe survives on give and take Death is an open door  It's a promise that you cannot break Was your life worth dying for? The universe survives on give and take Decay is the only law  As above, so below Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease As within, so without The seasons bring relief Just let me live and die in peace  It'll wear you down, through skin and bone It's as if my mind has a mind of it's own [x2]  When my heart skips two beats (I am hidden deep. Fast asleep) The sea will part, where oceans meet Finally complete  It's a promise that you cannot break Was your life worth dying for? The universe survives on give and take Death is an open door  It's a promise that you cannot break Was your life worth dying for? The universe survives on give and take Decay is the only law  Swan song A declaration of endlessness I swear I will not look back, as I return into the black When the veil lifts, how will I know? How will I know? Will I see God?  As above, so below Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease As within, so without The seasons bring relief Just let me live and die in peace
*"Silver Bullet"*Hey! There's no price to life When you're high on the white lie So lost I've beat death. (White!) Kill us (Lie!) Don't tell us  The devil that you know Knows no, no death is too low Right when they want you To, to get lost, to be strong Save us from the cure  With our heads in the sand we've left our lives in their hands The chemical miracle, the one you've been praying for With our heads in the sand we've left our lives in their hands Our condition is critical but we keep coming back for more  There's no price to hide When you're high on the white lie  Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh Hanging by a thread Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh Ready to drop dead  With our heads in the sand we've left our lives in their hands The chemical miracle, the one you've been praying for With our heads in the sand we've left our lives in their hands Our condition is critical but we keep coming back for more  Save us Save us From the cure
*"Death Is Not Defeat"*When I leave this skin and bone Beyond my final heartbeat I'll dismantle piece by piece And I will know that death is not defeat  When I leave this skin and bone Beyond my final heartbeat (heartbeat) I'll dismantle piece by piece And I will know that death is not defeat  Holding on tight to what's left of our time We've hidden away But it's in the design Why do we fight what we can't define? Don't be afraid, we all cross the same line  When I leave this skin and bone Beyond my final heartbeat I'll dismantle piece by piece And I will know that death is not defeat  Into the night we burn and rage In death we repay for time on this stage The lights are bright But don't lose your way 'Cause once it ignites The flame must decay  Now you're finally complete I will see you where oceans meet  Past and present merge Light and dark will converge Time will overthrow our reign on this throne  The everlasting sleep Returning through the veil Far beneath the deep Another soul sets sail  When I leave this skin and bone Beyond my final heartbeat I'll dismantle piece by piece And I will know that death is not defeat  When I leave this skin and bone Beyond my final heartbeat I'll dismantle piece by piece And I will know that death is not defeat
*"Hereafter"*Now the oceans have drained out Can I come up for air Cause I've been learning to live without And I'm fighting with broken bones  I wasn't ready for the rapture We're only passing through But these words, they mean nothing to me I know that time will mend this fracture I've been lost in a maze And every route I take leads right back to you  Now the oceans have drained out Can I come up for air Cause I've been learning to live without And I'm fighting with broken bones Now the skies have been blacked out I've gotta find my way Cause its been raining but there's a drought And I'm fighting with broken bones  I've been searching through the wreckage But it's like standing in the eye of a storm When will I finally get the message Some things are broken beyond repair This is my cross to bear My own meaningless catastrophe I never had the time to prepare Because I never knew that All my nightmares could come true  Now the oceans have drained out Can I come up for air Cause I've been learning to live without And I'm fighting with broken bones Now the skies have been blacked out I've gotta find my way Cause its been raining but there's a drought And I'm fighting with broken bones  I've spent my fair share In the deepest depths of despair Cause I was too lost down there to care I wasn't braced for the fallout Blegh I wasn't braced for the fallout  I've been searching through the wreckage But it's like standing in the eye of a storm When will I finally get the message Some things are broken beyond repair  Now the oceans have drained out Can I come up for air Cause I've been learning to live without And I'm fighting with broken bones Now the skies have been blacked out I've gotta find my way Cause its been raining but there's a drought And I'm fighting with broken bones
*"Holy Hell"*Maybe we'll never learn? The fire at the gates is our saving grace Remember, we were born to burn There is a holy hell, where we can save ourselves There is a holy hell, where we can save ourselves  We will be cast out of paradise It's a long ascent out of the black But we all have to sacrifice Hang the iconoclast And kiss the feet of the amnesiac 'Cause the moment is dead when I'm lost in the past  Maybe we'll never learn? The fire at the gates is our saving grace Remember, we were born to burn There is a holy hell, where we can save ourselves  But now the rivers are running red And the skies have been set ablaze I've been fearing the worst again Heavenly terrorist Have you been longing over yesterday? Don't forget to breathe when the knife begins to twist Fuck this self pity It's not that hard to see We get one chance These wounds will set me free There's poison on the key It brings you to your knees But even the mountains erode in the rain  A single spark can start a forest fire Light one match and burn down the empire There's gold buried in the blue, oh There's gold buried in the blue  Holy Hell, I've got nothing left to lose And I can tell there's gold buried in the blue  Maybe we'll never learn? The fire at the gates is our saving grace Remember, we were born to burn There is a holy hell, where we can save ourselves  Holy Hell, I've got nothing left to lose And I can tell there's gold buried in the blue  But even the mountains erode in the rain A single spark can start a forest fire Light one match and burn down the empire There's gold buried in the blue There's gold buried in the blue
*"Damnation"*We suffer to survive Are we desperate creatures crawling in the dirt? Or are we lonely preachers hiding our beating hearts?  We sow the wind and reap the storm Don't say you haven't been warned  No future's written There's endless possibility  We suffer to survive If hope is a prison, then maybe faith will set me free We suffer to survive Am I just a victim drifting in the raging sea? We suffer to survive  In the kingdom resides behind my own eyes I've got to catch the stone and cradle the wave Damnation is just a daydream away But still we carry on If I'm God in disguise praying for the rain And if our demons decide, then is this all in vain?  We sow the wind and reap the storm Don't say you haven't been warned  It's time to confess I haunt this flesh I answer my own prayers I bid my own despair  No future's written There's endless possibility  We suffer to survive If hope is a prison, then maybe faith will set me free We suffer to survive Am I just a victim drifting in the raging sea? We suffer to survive  But still, we carry on There's a lesson in this, what I resist persists And damnation is just a daydream away  If hope is a prison, then maybe faith will set me free We suffer to survive Am I just a victim drifting in the raging sea? We suffer to survive
*"Royal Beggars"*Royal beggars, royal beggars Do you, do you, do you wanna Live forever, live forever? Alone, alone, alone  'Cos we're broken All hope is dead But we're coping Somebody save our souls  Like a bird in a cage Trying to fly away Is this the price that we have to pay? Overflowing with rage Yet we still obey 'Cos we're asleep in a hurricane  Bitter lovers, bitter lovers Let go, let go, let go, 'cos it's Now or never, now or never Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in  'Cos we're choking And left for dead But we're coping Somebody save our souls  Like a bird in a cage Trying to fly away Is this the price that we have to pay? Overflowing with rage Yet we still obey 'Cos we're asleep in a hurricane  Are you listening? You may not have noticed We have totally lost our way Are you lost in the clouds? Or can you hold your focus? It's ourselves that we will betray  Are you listening? You may not have noticed We have totally lost our way Are you lost in the clouds? Or can you hold your focus? It's ourselves that we will betray  Like a bird in a cage Trying to fly away Is this the price that we have to pay? Overflowing with rage Yet we still obey 'Cos we're asleep in a hurricane  We sit on a throne waiting for god to bend the knee But we're nothing more than royal beggars  But I'm as guilty as the next man Our eyes are open, but we're not listening
*"Modern Misery"*Seven billion hungry ghosts Just a parasite killing its host The emperor wears no clothes, I see those brittle bones But we're buried by modern misery Modern misery  There's not enough water in the world To wash the blood from our hands We planted a seed, its roots will suffocate the soul It grows without light and feeds from our bones Hell must be empty, all the devils are here Singing us the Lord's Prayer; finally, something that we all share  I won't go to the grave with the song still in me  What are we hiding in the rain? This is a prison for lost souls Another life circles the drain We used to run with the wolves Now we can't see the forest 'Cause there's no light in the black hole Don't try and tell me we are blessed We used to run with the wolves  Are these our new messiahs? 'Cause the saviour has a gun to my head Don't be fooled by Maya, the kings are all thieves And the serpents will bite as they please How has it come to this?  I won't go to the grave with the song still in me And I won't live like a slave begging from my knees  What are we hiding in the rain? This is a prison for lost souls Another life circles the drain We used to run with the wolves Now we can't see the forest 'Cause there's no light in the black hole Don't try and tell me we are blessed We used to run with the wolves  Seven billion hungry ghosts Just a parasite killing its host The emperor wears no clothes, I see those brittle bones But we're buried by modern misery Modern misery I won't live like a slave, I won't beg from my knees I will not go to the grave with the song still in me  We used to run with the wolves We used to run with the wolves We used to run with the wolves We used to run with the wolves
*"Dying To Heal"*I found my way to the garden, but I couldn't see The cliff edge in front of me No cloud can catch me now  It brings me closer to God But keeps the dirt in the wound And now the beast has teeth  I've got my hand on my heart I thought that I knew the way But I've been torn apart  Now I know there's a holy grail But it's beyond the pale Why must we always fly so close to the sun? The silhouettes have fallen one by one 'Cause we forget that the sun sets And we're not long for this world No cloud can catch me now  I found my way to the garden, but I couldn't see The cliff edge in front of me  The devil's recruits whisper in my ear "Go tighten that noose", but it's clear I've gotta follow the thread Instead, I'll dream of the end, and I will raise the dead  We're all refusing to feel And yet we're dying to heal But there is only now And there's no easy way out  I found my way to the garden, but I couldn't see The cliff edge in front of me  Now I know there's a holy grail But it's beyond the pale Why must we always fly so close to the sun? The silhouettes have fallen one by one 'Cause we forget that the sun sets And now we're not long for this world No cloud can catch me now  I see no silver linings When the days are so dark So hold a flame to these words Enough pressure will create a diamond, oh  I see no silver linings When the days are so dark So hold a flame to these words Enough pressure will create a diamond Enough pressure will create a diamond
*"The Seventh Circle"*I don't wanna dream anymore I've buried it all too deep Every waking moment is war This is the seventh circle  I'm stepping off the edge I think I'd prefer oblivion I feel the blood drain from my face Maybe it's better to never have been  Too afraid to connect What can I do to repent? I've got to settle my regrets But first I've got to accept Some of us burn too bright I'm holding on too tight I think I'm done with reality  I don't wanna dream anymore I've buried it all too deep Every waking moment is war This is the seventh circle  I don't wanna dream anymore I've buried it all too deep Every waking moment is war This is the seventh circle  I don't wanna dream anymore I've buried it all too deep Every waking moment is war This is the seventh circle
*"Doomsday"*Remember when hell had frozen over? The cold still burns underneath my skin The water is rising all around me And there is nothing left I can give  All these tears I've shed I saw the wildfire spread You said you cheated death But heaven was in my head  They say the good die young No use in saying what is done is done 'Cause it's not enough And when the night gives way It's like a brand new doomsday What will be will be Every river flows into the sea But it's never enough And when the night gives way It's like a brand new doomsday No matter what they say It's like a brand new doomsday  The embers still glow when I'm sober The gold in the flame burns brighter now I have to rebuild, now it's over Maybe now I'm lost I can live  Souls don't break, they bend But I sometimes forget I have to do this for you And the only way out is through  Death is an open door  Words the prophets said Still swimming through my head Now there's no stars left in the sky 'Cause this well will never run dry What if I completely forget? What if I never accept? 'Cause when you fade away It's like a brand new doomsday  They say the good die young No use in saying what is done is done 'Cause it's not enough And when the night gives way It's like a brand new doomsday What will be will be Every river flows into the sea But it's never enough And when the night gives way It's like a brand new doomsday No matter what they say It's like a brand new doomsday
*"A Wasted Hymn"*All is not lost, all is not lost All is not lost, all is not lost All is not lost, all is not lost All is not lost, all is not lost  Waiting for a sign Washed up on the shoreline I'll always carry the cross But all is not lost I just can't relate A crack in the floodgate Life comes at a cost But all is not lost  Is this penance for my sins? I gave everything for this phantom limb Holy Ghost Nothing lasts forever Now it's time to sink or swim I've got nothing except this wasted hymn Holy Ghost Nothing lasts forever  Taking back what's mine But it's lost to the skyline A bridge I cannot cross But all is not lost Now there's no escape God, what a sorry state Love comes at a cost But all is not lost  Is this penance for my sins? I gave everything for this phantom limb Holy Ghost Nothing lasts forever Now it's time to sink or swim I've got nothing except this wasted hymn Holy Ghost Nothing lasts forever  Can you feel the empty space? Can you feel the fire at the gates? Can you live a life worth dying for? Can you feel the empty space? Can you feel the fire at the gates? Can you live a life worth dying for? Can you feel the empty space? Can you feel the fire at the gates? Can you live a life worth dying for?  Is this penance for my sins? I gave everything for this phantom limb Holy Ghost Nothing lasts forever  Now it's time to sink or swim I've got nothing except this wasted hymn Holy Ghost Nothing lasts forever
*"Do You Dream Of Armageddon?"*No tree can grow to heaven 'Til its roots reach down to hell Will we ever learn our lesson? We all fall in parallel  No tree can grow to heaven 'Til its roots reach down to hell Will we ever learn our lesson? We all fall in parallel  Don't bury the confession There's a light behind the shell Do you dream of Armageddon Just to get yourself to heaven?  We all fall in parallel We all fall in parallel We all fall in parallel We all fall in parallel We all fall in parallel
*"Black Lungs"*Do you cross your heart when you hope to die? Are you sleeping deep in the hurricane? IVs in the arm, forgetting to feel We're crawling on all fours Will you fall on that sword at the second coming? You're gonna taste the ash and dust 'Cause this world is dying in our arms  Now the wheels are turning What would you do to stay alive if the planet was burning?  You wanna make your hell a reality? Black lungs for the young if they dare to breathe (If they dare to breathe, woah) Sure sounds like heaven to me You've gotta cut the roots to kill the weeds No place to go if we don't believe (If we don't believe, woah) Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint  Give us a Judas steer we can deify Yeah, we all pretend we're the renegades So wash us away, garroted by a halo Take a bow, 'cause time's running out There's no doubt that the end is coming You're gonna taste the ash, you're gonna taste the dust 'Cause this world is dying in our arms  Now the wheels are turning What would you do to stay alive if the planet was burning?  You wanna make your hell a reality? Black lungs for the young if they dare to breathe (If they dare to breathe, woah) Sure sounds like heaven to me You've gotta cut the roots to kill the weeds No place to go if we don't believe (If we don't believe, woah) Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint  Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint  Post love, post truth, justice lays bound And black bagged ready for the guillotine We can all plead guilty when they ask "Where were you when the Gods clipped the wings of the Phoenix?"

We'll be waiting Will enough be enough when we're holding on for dear life  You wanna make your hell a reality? Black lungs for the young if they dare to breathe (If they dare to breathe, woah) Sure sounds like heaven to me You've gotta cut the roots to kill the weeds No place to go if we don't believe (If we don't believe, woah) Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint It's enough to plague a saint It's enough to plague a saint It's enough to plague a saint  We can all plead guilty when they ask "Where were you when the Gods clipped the wings of the Phoenix?"
*"Giving Blood"*The Gospel, distorted It leaves my blood running cold But still they say I'm rigging the ritual  I never said that I was giving blood for the unbelievers Bleeding out like a devil in disguise They shot a hole in the parachute 'Cause I'd rather feel alive  It's so convoluted They're just trepanning for gold May they rest in peace 'Cause they're fucking dead to me  Well there's your eulogy The water's polluted My feathers caught in the spill Nobody said that it would be safe up here  I never said that I was giving blood for the unbelievers Bleeding out like a devil in disguise They shot a hole in the parachute 'Cause I'd rather feel alive  Your salvation's a let down Oh I'm sorry that I'd rather feel I'd rather feel alive  It leaves a mark on the mind It weaves a web in the background Silently No time to spare No sign of the exit wound God help me There's no drying off Once you're soaked right down to the bone Hopefully Somebody thinks of me in the aftermath Woe is me  It leaves a mark on the mind It weaves a web in the background Silently No time to spare No sign of the exit wound God help me There's no drying off Once you're soaked right down to the bone Hopefully Somebody thinks of me in the aftermath Woe is me  Woe is me I'm so sorry I'm so sorry  I never said that I was giving blood for the unbelievers Bleeding out like a devil in disguise They shot a hole in the parachute 'Cause I'd rather feel alive  Your salvation's a let down Oh I'm sorry that I'd rather feel I'd rather feel alive
*"Discourse Is Dead"*Oh, it just won't calculate A prophecy with a twist Do you really think Christ was a capitalist? Every man for himself Let thy neighbour drown Amen  So sing us a sad song So sing us to sleep 'Cause we all dance around the carousel Chewing through our tongues Now discourse is dead  Stood at the tip of the wing You've gotta watch where you tread  Round up the ambivalent You mustn't sit in the shade 'Cause it's blasphemous For one to abstain from hate We're all sisters and brothers But if you're one of the others Then fuck you  So sing us a sad song So sing us to sleep 'Cause we all dance around the carousel Chewing through our tongues  So save me the sermon You all sound the same 'Cause we all dance around the carousel Chewing through our tongues  No common sense left in these empty heads Swimming towards the storm Two beating hearts Two poles apart  No common sense left in these empty heads Swimming towards the storm Two beating hearts Two poles apart  So sing us a sad song So sing us to sleep 'Cause we all dance around the carousel Chewing through our tongues  So save me the sermon You all sound the same 'Cause we all dance around the carousel Chewing through our tongues Now discourse is dead  Stood at the tip of the wing You've gotta watch where you tread Don't look down Let thy neighbour drown Now discourse is dead
*"Dead Butterflies"*I wanna bother God I wanna feel the ground beneath my feet But I've got a smile full of broken teeth  Goodbye, all the doves have flown away I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself  I know it's not enough Why does defeat always taste so bittersweet? I just wanna live and die in peace  The flower that never blossoms is quickly forgotten It must be gold if it's glistening I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself  Goodbye, all the doves have flown away I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself Fly high 'cause the ravens are here to stay I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself in a cloud of  Dead butterflies, dead butterflies, dead butterflies, dead butter...

*"An Ordinary Extinction"*Do you feel at home in limbo? Hiding a broken vow A phantom at the window  Can you swallow the shame? Has your courage been burnt out, faded away? There won't be a saviour in sight, but it's okay 'Cause we're comfortable  We're stood at the edge of the world Seize the snakes They're living a lie, blinded by a candle They're saying goodbye We're stood at the edge of the world  When the clock runs down to zero We'll stand up and take a bow So quick to play the hero  Are you fanning the flames? Are you torching the lighthouse? Stood in the way Complicity burning so bright yet we delay Are you culpable?  Seize the snakes They're living a lie, blinded by a candle They're saying goodbye We're stood at the edge of the world  Drag the lake When the water runs dry, we'll be slaves to the anchor The Devil may cry We're stood at the edge of the world  We're stood at the edge of the world  Nothing is holy We all take the blame Crumbling slowly The cliff face belongs to the ocean So run for your life  Do you remember the tip of the spear? The edge of the knife? We're freshly dismembered But won't shed a tear So run for your life  We're stood at the edge of the world Seize the snakes They're living a lie, blinded by a candle They're saying goodbye We're stood at the edge of the world  Drag the lake When the water runs dry, we'll be slaves to the anchor The Devil may cry We're fighting to stay alive How can we all survive? No second chances We're stood at the edge of the world  We're stood at the edge of the world, yeah We're fighting to stay alive
*"Impermanence"*We've got a choice but still we'd rather choose to suffer 'Cause there's no escape once the fuse is lit Locked in this pantheon Swimming with concrete shoes The reaper comes to take the best of you Can you see the writing on the wall?  There is a subtle space that we'll all discover 'Cause there is a seat reserved for the spirit Passing through one by one Riding a torpedo We wash away into the overflow Can you see the writing on the wall?  We're barricaded 'Cause nobody wants to meet their maker The seeds are sewn then we die alone, we die alone Eviscerated We're all players in a symphony That fights against impermanence Again, and again, and again, and again, and again Again, and again, and again!  Do you really wanna live forever?  We are so lost staring into all the colour It hurts but reality is counterfeit We came from the beyond Living a cameo One final breath and then we split in two Can you see the writing on the wall?  We're barricaded 'Cause nobody wants to meet their maker The seeds are sewn then we die alone, we die alone Eviscerated We're all players in a symphony That fights against impermanence Again, and again, and again, and again, and again  Even the doomed refuse We were born to lose Do you really wanna live forever? 'Cause those afraid to die will never truly live They'll never truly live  Even the doomed refuse We were born to lose Do you really wanna live forever?  We're barricaded 'Cause nobody wants to meet their maker The seeds are sewn then we die alone, we die alone Eviscerated We're all players in a symphony That fights against impermanence Again, and again, and again, and again  We are barricaded 'Cause nobody wants to meet their maker The seeds are sewn then we die alone, we die alone Eviscerated We're all players in a symphony That fights against impermanence Again, and again, and again, and again, and again
*"Flight Without Feathers"*There's a rose that blooms Through the cracks in the concrete Staining the prison floor There's a pilgrimage waiting Sat at the doorstep Rotting beneath the sun  When there's nowhere left to hide, we'll be searching for a shortcut Ire and denial are as thick as thieves Soon there'll be nothing left of me, nothing left of me Don't forget to breathe, don't forget to breathe, don't forget to breathe Tell me how to coexist when a fraction only wants war Hopelessly in love with our gritted teeth Soon there'll be nothing left of me, nothing left of me Don't forget to breathe, I forgot to breathe And look who's on the throne now  I'm a dead heretic With no storm left to weather Afraid to admit It won't sustain the spirit A new counterfeit Like flight without feathers Ready to submit It won't sustain the spirit  It won't sustain the spirit  So we fall to our knees And beg for reprieve But it's almost time for the curtain call The apostles will sing And lead us from sin But they hold all of our bones in their hands  We all swim against the tide until it puts us on the back foot Nothing's ever taste half as good as grief Soon there'll be nothing left of me, nothing left of me Don't forget to breathe, don't forget to breathe, don't forget to breathe 'Cause I'm staring at a fist and it's asking if I want more Clarity will visit but it's only brief Soon there'll be nothing left of me, nothing left of me Don't forget to breathe, don't forget to breathe Don't forget to breathe  I'm a dead heretic With no storm left to weather Afraid to admit It won't sustain the spirit A new counterfeit Like flight without feathers Ready to submit It won't sustain the spirit  It won't sustain the spirit It won't sustain the spirit It won't sustain the spirit It won't sustain the spirit
*"Little Wonder"*Burn the altar built by the dollar sign Those waters are shallow That's why the kids all say 'Get the fuck out of our way' 'Cause we're picking up the slack Taking power back Yeah, they made a bed out of our bones Said it's all just overblown It doesn't matter if you're friend or if you're foe Do you really think you wanna be saved?  I wanna sing you a different song One that's easier to swallow (Everything is fucking fine) We can dance we can all sing along We can say how we all wanna be saved But it's easier to follow  I wanna sing you a different song One that's easier to swallow We all say that we wanna be saved But it's easier to follow  There are vultures preaching the party line Those goldmines are hallowed And if we look away then we'll all have hell to pay So we cover up the tracks There's no going back Yeah, I know that Rome was overthrown But it wasn't done alone And you would think that we were better off below Were you hoping that the dead could be raised?  I wanna sing you a different song One that's easier to swallow (Everything is fucking fine) We can dance we can all sing along We can say how we all wanna be saved But it's easier to follow  I wanna sing you a different song One that's easier to swallow We can say how we all wanna be saved But it's easier to follow  If we miss the deadline we can always blame the Divine Gripping knives and praising lowlives Nobody could say with a straight face They didn't have it coming  They fucking had it coming They fucking had it coming  I wanna sing you a different song One that's easier to swallow We can dance we can all sing along We can say how we all wanna be saved But it's easier to follow  I wanna sing you a different song One that's easier to swallow We'll say that we wanna be saved If we miss the deadline we can always blame the Divine Gripping knives and praising lowlives Nobody could say with a straight face They didn't have it coming
*"Animals"*I do my best, but everything seems ominous Not feeling blessed, quite the opposite This shouldn't feel so monotonous It never rains, but it pours  We're just a bunch of fucking animals But we're afraid of the outcome Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in Says I should pull the pin  Should I just pull the pin? Should I just pull the pin?  I dug my heels, I thought that I could stop the rot The ground gave way, now I've lost the plot Fucked it again, that was all I've got It never rains, but it pours  Life is just a dream within a...  We're just a bunch of fucking animals But we're afraid of the outcome Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in Says I should pull the pin  Buried under dirt, a diamond in the mud Infinity is waiting there 'cause nobody can burn a glass cathedral  Dream within a, dream within a...

*"Kentucky Coal Miner's Prayer"*Deep in the mountain of Harlan County Employed by the Cumberland coal company The pay is short, the days are long But our labor union laws are coming on strong So I drink this whiskey for my throat  Wear my hard hat and weathered coat Early every morning I stand in line Waiting to work these Kentucky coal mines  We enter the shaft around five thirty With two dozen hands, cold, callused and dirty We'll dig through a million tons of rock and clay And we'll still be digging at the end of the day Down on our knees we confess our sins And pray that the roof above don't cave in  So bless our hearts and save or souls And the air we breathe down in the devil's hole Just last week when the the ceiling fell The explosion trapped us in the depths of hell  The weight of the earth took poor Tucker's life Leaving behind a hungry baby and wife We dug out with our shovels and picks But soon enough the black lung disease will make us sick  So bless our hearts and save or souls And the air we breathe down in the devil's hole I work deep in the mountains of eastern Kentucky  I know if I leave Harlan alive I'll be more than lucky Wish I could go to Texas and plant some cottonseed But moving takes money and I've got three mouths to feed So I drink this whiskey for my throat Wear my hard hat and weathered coat Early every morning I stand in line Waiting to work another Kentucky coal mine

The boys down at the shop know and they laugh until I cry I told 'em, if I mess this up, my momma's gonna tan my hide.  [Chorus]  I gave up that can of Snuff, no more NASCAR on TV.

*"3rd Gear & 17"*I held the keys to that Chevrolet  and you held the keys to my heart I'd throw a fit, hit the dash, get out and kick the tire when that old piece of junk wouldn't start It'd be smoking good I'm slam down the hood Just to see you laughing at me On the other side of a dirty windshield, lookin' as pretty as could be  We sure saw a lot of miles, never even crossed that county line I would've bet the farm, given my right arm so you'd always be mine Did we crash and burn or make a wrong turn or run out of gasoline? I lost you around 3rd gear and 17  In the blink of an eye high school flew by you went your way and I went mine But we swore we'd make it, our love could take it 400 miles could stand the test of time  Well I left that fall to play college ball, but my dreams would all come to an end 'Cause you know the big leagues never called, and you went and fell in love with him  We sure saw a lot of miles, never even crossed that county line I would've bet the farm, given my right arm so you'd always be mine Did we crash and burn or make a wrong turn or run out of gasoline?

I lost you around 3rd gear and 17  Love broke down around 3rd gear and 17 I lost you around 3rd gear and 17

*"Hollywood"*About every time you turn on your television there's another so-called movie star either suing somebody or going back to jail or out of rehab and right back to the bar.  I bet you heard about the two celebrities. They threw away a fortune on their wedding day. Looking back they should have fed half the world instead and now they are getting a divorce in LA.

Cause all the money in your dog eat dog kind of world couldn't buy you a lick of happiness. No Hollywood wouldn't know love if love walked up and gave Hollywood a kiss.   No Hollywood wouldn't know love if love walked up and gave Hollywood a kiss.
*"High Price Of Fame"*As sad as the sound of an old steel guitar A driftin' cowboy rode away with her heart All the boozing' and using' Audrey couldn't win for loosing' Left forever in the back of that Cadillac  Beautiful Jessie had only one flaw Fallin' head over heels for a Texas outlaw Puttin' up with Waymore took way more than she had She was the good-hearted woman through the good and the bad  And all those highways and heartaches All the mistakes a man makes Where's the glitter and gold as the shadows unfold Everyone knows his name but she pays the high price of fame  Johnny knew June was heaven sent Was addicted and busted heartbroken and bent She was color and light to the dark side of his soul Lovin' a man in black sometimes took its toll  And all those highways and heartaches All the mistakes a man makes Where's the glitter and gold as the shadows unfold Everyone knows his name but she pays the high price of fame  As I'm singing this song I'm thinkin' bout you Wondering is this worth all that I've put us through  All those highways and heartaches All the mistakes that I made Where's the glitter and gold as the shadows unfold Everyone knows my name but you pay the high price of fame

*"After The Rodeo"*Just a worn out truck, a coffee cup And another night out on the interstate It's not exactly where he thought he'd be When he reached this age  There is an old man staring back at him in the rear view With a million miles of life in his eyes And makes him ask those questions he don't want to Oh, but it might be time  Does a shooting star miss the sky When it hits the ground? And how long can a woman go on loving you If you're not around?  The years are flying faster now So tell me how eight seconds feel so slow And I wonder where old cowboys go After the rodeo  There's a house and eighty acres he calls home When he's not on the road And a woman who's been true to him so long But lonely, sure gets old  Lately he's been thinking 'bout her all the time And on nights like this he'll miss her most of all His body and his mind knows that he needs to find A softer place to fall  Does a shooting star miss the sky When it hits the ground? And how long can a woman go on loving you If you're not around?  The years are flying faster now So tell me how eight seconds feel so slow And I wonder where old cowboys go After the rodeo Lord, I wonder where old cowboys go

*"Turn Around"*Young man on the side of the road. Lost and beat up with nowhere to go. Smells like a hangover from days ago, but he does what he can to survive. Single mom with a dead end job. 90 hour week just to keep what shes got. But the bills add up and now shes caught. She does what she can to survive. Well, let me say that love wont take away the pain. But dont be afraid cause it will never walk away.  If your scared that you dont matter. If your lost and need to be found. If your lookin for a savior. All you gotta do is turn around.  Some turn to a bottle. Some turn to a drug. Some turn to anothers arms, but it seems like its never enough.

*"Ghost Of Guy Clark"*The old man was sitting on the tailgate of a '62 Ford flatbed Picking on an old guitar he looked at me and said, "The engine's dead It was a good run son", as he strummed a melancholy chord "Now I've got nothing but time to kill until the coming of the Lord"  Well he played me a few songs, one about a Randall knife One about a train, one about the pain of losing the love of his life He took a puff of that cigarette, blew a breath of smoke that could smother He said, "They always said these would kill me, and they did" then he laughed, and he lit another  He said "I hear that you write songs, boy, play me one that I might know" So I sang him my latest greatest hit, a number one on Music Row He stopped me before I could finish the verse, said, "I think I've heard enough of that When you've heard one, you've heard 'em all" with a grimace of a grin he took his old guitar back  He said, "I guess that's alright if that's all you've got to give If that's all you've got to say, in this one life you've got to live There's no meaning in your melody, so predictable and weak Wasted words and shallow rhymes, I'd rather hear a woman cuss me a blue streak"  "You see, the pencil to the pad is like the bullet to the gun The pen is mightier than the sword if the words are forged from fire from the sun Yet some do it for the fame, the fun, the money and all the glory Yet some do it for their weary soul wont rest until they tell their story"  "You gotta make 'em feel what you feel, help 'em dream a dream and make 'em wonder It's like catch lightning in a bottle, make 'em smell the rain and hear the thunder Let 'em taste the tears of joy or the bittersweet taste of sin Find the passion in a four letter word or a Sunday morning 'amen'"  And then flicked his ashes and he pointed at my heart Said, "If you're searching for solid gold, that'd be a real good place to start Let the words speak for themselves, tell the truth, right or wrong Bare your soul for all to see, all for the sake of the song"

*"Too Mean To Die"*I'm a heavy metal warrior, restless son of a bitch A weapon of destruction with both hands on the switch Walk right through the fire with venom in my veins Breaking down the doors, kicking ass and taking names  Striking just like lightning, forward without fear Don't think twice about it, never shed a tear Stalk like a chameleon, hiding in plain sight You won't see me coming, too late just say goodnight  I'm a man on a mission You'll never kill me And I'm a man with a vision You're too blind to see  I'm too mean to die I'm too mean to die Spit right in your eye  Poison and infection, parasites and pain Can't live within me, they all go up in flames Powered by adrenaline, vengeance is the creed Focused like a pit bull, satisfaction guaranteed  I'm a man on a mission You'll never kill me And I'm a man with a vision You're just too blind to see  I'm too mean to die I'm too mean to die I've got to live forever I'm too mean to die Too mean to die  You can't kill me I was born to survive Got the heart of a lion I'm a cat with nine lives  I'm too mean to die Too mean to die I'm too mean to die I just might live forever I'm too mean to die Too mean to die

*"Symphony Of Pain"*By the hand of fate, knocking on my door Taken all the magic, forevermore Torn by secrecy, not a whisper on the wind Solitude is torment, to the end  Trapped in silence, how I loathe this sanctity Imprisoned by this irony Darkened delusion, seeking only to embed Melodies held hostage in my head  This has to be, my agony Can someone break these chains?  Yeah It's a silent prison This symphony of pain Oh can't you listen To this symphony of pain  Dispel this agony, oh, someone hear my prayer This sorrow's too much to bear Lost in loneliness, concede to destiny Only my music sets me free  My rhapsody, of tragedy Can someone break these chains?  Yeah It's a silent prison This symphony of pain Oh can't you listen To this symphony of pain  It's a silent prison This symphony of pain The world shall listen To my symphony of pain This symphony of pain
*"The Best Is Yet To Come"*Once I was a man of fortune Lived my life with pearls and gold Had my time with wine and roses I never thought of getting old  Time went by and I got wiser Loved and lost, along the way I found the meaning of forgiveness Pardoned enemies and prey  When it rains, I look for rainbows When it's dark, I see the stars Call me a dreamer, call me nave I will always say, the best is yet to come Call me a simple man, call me nave On my dying bed I'll say, the best is yet to come  Many times, I feel like screaming Bang my head against the wall Watch my luck run through my fingers Losing faith in all  Then I close my eyes in silence Feel the spirit, that I crave April showers, bring May flowers Growing on my grave  When it rains, I look for rainbows When it's dark, I see the stars Call me a dreamer, call me nave I will always say the best is yet to come Call me a simple man, call me nave On my dying bed I'll say, the best is yet to come  The best is yet to come The best is yet to come  When it rains, I look for rainbows When it's dark, I see the stars  On my dying bed I'll say, the best is yet to come  On my dying bed I'll say The best is yet to come
*"How Do We Sleep"*What do you say, when there's nothing left to say? When all the words are spoken, and the silence runs astray? The thoughts have all been written down, the pen is laid aside Do you feel your mind at peace, or do you feel as though you've died?  It's a war of truth and lies A search for right and wrong Who will fall and who will rise The battle rages on  How do we sleep at night? With the world around us going to hell Tell me, how do we justify? We do nothing, nothing changes at all  In a thousand years from now, the winners they will be praised The history books will all be burned, that told of other ways So when tomorrow morning comes, to bring another day We'd better test our mettle, before we fade away  When good men stop and stand aside The evil ones succeed They take for granted all we've done And watch the planet bleed  So how do we sleep at night? With the world around us going to hell Tell me, how do we justify? We do nothing, nothing changes at all  Who will fall and who will rise A search for right and wrong It's a war of truth and lies The battle's raging on  How do we sleep at night? With the world around us going to hell Tell me, how do we justify? We do nothing, and nothing changes at all
